				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_161765057.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859" alt="shutterstock_161765057" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_161765057.jpg" width="600" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>Crafts are fun! Holidays are fun! Giving is fun! So making Valentine cards for the class should be a blast, right? Right.</p>
<p>But sometimes, when you find yourself up late in a Pinterest-induced frenzy, covered in glitter and blaming your Kindergarten teacher for your inability to cut straight lines, the generic multi-pack of cards at the convenience store seems like sheer genius, worthy of a mom-awarded Nobel prize of sorts. (We&#8217;ve all been there, right? No? Just me?)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the multi-pack, but if you&#8217;re hoping to accomplish something mostly kid-created, homemade and cost effective, there are possibilities that don&#8217;t have to involve late nights and glitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_24403159.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855" alt="shutterstock_24403159" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_24403159.jpg" width="450" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The dollar store can be a mom&#8217;s best friend on a mission like this. Stock up on index cards, markers, a stapler and staples, glue, baggies and maybe some construction paper and stickers if you&#8217;re feeling really inspired. Ideally, you&#8217;d have some sort of craft box with all of these supplies neatly filed away somewhere for projects like this, so if you haven&#8217;t checked that off of the list yet, grab a bin and some extra supplies for stocking up. If you have young children, you have a lifetime of arts and crafts ahead and may as well be prepared.</p>
<p>Your next stop is the party supply section. This is a great spot to inexpensively buy items in bulk. Here are some ideas to use as inspiration:</p>
<p><b>Glow stick bracelets</b>&#8211; Using scissors, make two small slits in an index card and thread the glow-in-the-dark bracelet through the holes. Print &#8220;You light up my life!&#8221; on the card and have your child sign their name and decorate.</p>
<p><b>Bouncy balls&#8211;</b> Cut construction paper into quarters and write, &#8220;Hope you have a ball today!&#8221; on the bottom half of the paper along with your child&#8217;s signature. Fold the paper in half and staple it to the top of the bag with a ball in it.</p>
<p><b>Rulers or pencils&#8211;</b>Yes, it&#8217;s practical and that&#8217;s often no fun, but the kids will get plenty of goodies and teachers will appreciate having the extra supplies around. Use tape, rubber cement, or cut slits into index cards to attach the treat and add a catchy phrase like, &#8220;You rule!&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re just write!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Fake mustaches&#8211; </b>Ridiculous mustaches are all the rage lately and a great way to spread the silliness. Make up cards that say, &#8220;I mustache you a question? Will you be my valentine?&#8221; and affix a mustache to each, using double-sided tape or rubber cement. You may want to use a printer for this one because writing that out for an entire classroom of kids doesn&#8217;t sound like much fun.</p>
<p><b>Candy&#8211;</b> If you&#8217;re set on sending something sweet, get extra creative by taking a photograph of your child reaching his or her closed fist toward the camera and then pick up the prints at your nearest convenience store. Make a small hole in the fist area of each photo and insert a lollipop to provide a three dimensional feel. Sure, it&#8217;s a little less kid-created and a little more involved than the other options but it&#8217;s also inexpensive fun. Feel free to take the easy route and give out a roll of Smarties candy with a card that says, &#8220;You&#8217;re such a Smartie!&#8221; or go organic and pick up honey straws from a nearby farmer&#8217;s market with a &#8220;Won&#8217;t you BEE mine?&#8221; card.</p>
<p>With some minor preparation and a plan, your family can enjoy a stress-free crafting session that can involve more love than labor this Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_119549464.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-849" alt="shutterstock_119549464" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_119549464.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Do you really need that kitchen gadget? Some tools can only be used for a single purpose, and that can be a drain on cabinet and drawer space. But when gadgets can do double duty by performing tasks you may have never thought of, they become a great item to hang on to.</p>
<p>Wondering if your favorites have uses you haven’t thought of? Here are some unexpected ways to get more out of five common kitchen gadgets.</p>
<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_123352249.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-845" alt="shutterstock_123352249" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_123352249.jpg" width="268" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><b>Whisks</b>: Sure, you are used to using your handy whisks for whipping up fluffy eggs for omelets and sauces. But did you know that whisks are also super for quick and easy sifting of dry ingredients? Try using a whisk to sift together your flour, baking powder or soda and other ingredients when making breads, cookies, etc.</p>
<p><b>French Press</b>: Don’t let that French press gather dust in the cabinet! Try adding warm milk to the press to create almost-instant milk foam for your at-home lattes (simply use the press to aerate the milk by raising and lowing it rapidly). Or add a little heavy cream, confectioners sugar and a dash of vanilla and use the press to make easy whipped cream. French presses can also be used to make loose tea (follow the same process as making coffee!).</p>
<p><b>Micro Handheld Graters</b>: Sure, it might be meant for cheeses, but when you have a handheld grater with small grates, it becomes a fantastic multi-purpose tool. It can freshly grate your favorite hard cheeses for pastas, prepare fresh nutmeg (nutmeg is grated – and fresh is fabulous), fresh the zest from lemons, limes and oranges, grate ginger for recipes and even grate garlic for a quick garlic paste.</p>
<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_1298658231.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-843" alt="Multi-use baking tray" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_1298658231.jpg" width="266" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><b>Muffin Tins</b>: While these handy baking trays are great for whipping up muffins and cupcakes, there is so much more that you can use them for. For instance, did you know that hard cooked eggs can be made (super easily!) in a muffin tin in the oven? Just place the eggs in the muffin cups and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  You can also use muffin tins as a serving dish for special toppings for chili, salads and more. Just fill each cavity with a different topping (hint – muffin tins with six cavities work best for this).</p>
<p><b>Keurig Brewer</b>: Your favorite morning brews aren’t the only thing that the Keurig can do for you. Skip the pod and use it to heat water for your favorite just-add-water dishes like instant oatmeal, instant noodles and more (hint: you can put bowls right under the spout for easy adding!).</p>

Spending dedicated time as a family leads to precious memories and enjoyable traditions that last a lifetime. Though your budget may be stretched thin — especially during this post-holiday season — it’s still possible to enjoy fun, inexpensive activities together as a family, says <a href="http://www.clarelevison.com/" target="_blank">Clare Levison</a>, CPA, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frugal-Isnt-Cheap-Spend-Better/dp/1601632606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386704258&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=frugal+isnt+cheap" target="_blank">&#8220;Frugal Isn&#8217;t Cheap: Spend Less, Save More, and Live Better&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>“Quality time and wonderful memories don&#8217;t have to come with a big price tag,” says Levison, who has two children. “Enjoying inexpensive activities allows you to save money for things like a house down payment, college or retirement. And less strain on your budget means less stress for you and your family.”</p>
<p>The following inexpensive and free activities are sure to lead to family bonding experiences.</p>
<p><strong>1. Get crafty</strong><br />
A wide variety of fun craft kits exist. Try a collaborative paint-by-number masterpiece with the whole family by assigning everyone their own numbers. Or use stamps to make holiday gift thank you cards for friends and family members. Clay creations are another fun activity. Mold masterpieces like colorful bowls and then dry them for future use. Make sure to have everyone put their names on the bottom of the bowls.</p>
<p><strong>2. Play games</strong><br />
Have a puzzle contest to see who can complete their puzzle the fastest. Then take turns playing everyone’s favorite board games. Or create your own board game using poster board. Draw out the various stages of the game, raid the junk drawer for items that can be used as game pieces and print out paper money.</p>
<p><strong>3. Write a winter poem</strong><br />
Put your creative thinking caps on and see where inspiration leads you. If the kids are old enough, let them each write their own verses. Even young children can help come up with rhymes. Write the poem in a notebook that the kids decorate, and continue the tradition for every season. You’ll end up with a best-selling family heirloom.</p>
<p><strong>4. Read together</strong><br />
Visit your local library and pick out a book the whole family can enjoy. At home, make some hot chocolate and take turns reading out loud. This family bonding experience has the added bonus of giving young readers a chance to practice their reading skills.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make homemade treats</strong><br />
Get out your favorite dessert cookbooks or look online for recipes to make yummy treats such as cookies, cupcakes or candy. Plenty of tempting confections you usually buy in the store can be made at home, such as toffee, rock candy, cotton candy and <a href="http://candy.about.com/od/gumgelatinbasedcandy/a/gummy_hub.htm">gummies</a>. If you prefer salty snacks, homemade potato chips are always a hit.</p>
<p><strong>6. Start an indoor garden from kitchen scraps</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.healthyhouseplants.com/index.php/growing-house-plants-for-kitchen-scraps.html">Growing houseplants from kitchen scraps</a> is an enjoyable activity for the whole family. A surprising number of vegetable and fruit scraps transform into eye-catching plants, such as sweet potatoes, which create sprawling vines, avocados, which grow into small trees, and pineapples, which may even eventually grow fruit — even if planted indoors.</p>
<p><strong>7. People watch</strong><br />
Go to the mall, get everyone a snack and make a game of watching shoppers. Once the passersby is out of ear shot, compare notes on what each of you think the person is buying at the mall, who he or she bought the items for and where he or she will go next. You&#8217;ll all most likely be wrong, but you’ll have a great time guessing.</p>
<p><strong>8. Visit a national, state or local park</strong><br />
In addition to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm">365 federal parks</a>, there are innumerable local and state destinations from which to choose. Pack a picnic lunch and head out to enjoy nature&#8217;s bounty. If it’s too cold to dine outdoors, eat your spread in the car as you make a game of trying to spot wildlife. Bring along binoculars. Don&#8217;t forget a camera to photograph the special moments sure to occur on your adventure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/010314-PushPenny-Fitness.jpg" alt="010314-PushPenny-Fitness" width="600" height="204" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-832" />Are costly gym memberships standing between you and your Beyonce body? Don&#8217;t let tight financial times hold you back from accomplishing your 2014 fitness goals. Diversify your workout with home and outdoor solutions that will lead you to the promised land of sculpted gams!</p>
<p>Before lacing up your running shoes, make a cohesive, goal-oriented schedule.</p>
<p>“Plan specific days to work each body part. Sit out your workout clothes on the nightstand,” advises Sia Cooper, creator of <a href="http://fitmommydiaries.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Diary of a Fit Mommy</a>. The Florida-based exercise buff transformed her body — without a gym. Creative visualization also helped her.</p>
<p>“Set your (computer) background to someone … who&#8217;s fit level you would like to achieve. My background was fitness model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Eason" target="_blank">Jamie Eason</a> for the longest time!” she admits. Eason won the title of World&#8217;s Fittest Model and is a former NFL cheerleader.</p>
<p>Aside from falling prey to lurking temptation in the nearby kitchen, the biggest mistake people make with home workouts is the lack of preparation and “…not warming up,” says exercise physiologist <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christi-hampton/4b/157/21b" target="_blank">Christi Hampton</a>. The certified wellness program coordinator, who has worked in corporate fitness and private training in Washington D.C. and New York, stresses: “A dynamic warm up protects you from injury. Take 5-10 minutes to prepare the body for movement.”</p>
<p>Both agree that using household items is key. Say goodbye to the almighty Stairmaster, and jog up your staircase instead. Rely on sturdy kitchen chairs for tricep dips, one-legged lunges and step ups. They recommend filling up two empty one-gallon water jugs (weighing up to 9 pounds when full), to act as dumbbells. Low-cost accessories can also enhance your routine. Cooper’s favorites include a <a href="http://www.kmart.com/weider-55cm-stability-ball/p-080W003897152000P?prdNo=5&amp;blockNo=5&amp;blockType=G5 kettlebells" target="_blank">fitness ball</a> ($11-Kmart), <a href="http://www.target.com/p/marcy-30-lb-kettle-weight-set-vkbs30/-/A-13019813#?lnk=sc_qi_detailbutton" target="_blank">kettlebells</a> ($40.99 Target) and<br />
and a <a href="http://www.sears.com/sunny-health-fitness-speed-rope/p-00648167000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&amp;kpid=00648167000&amp;kispla=00648167000P" target="_blank">jump rope</a> (Sears, $3.77).</p>
<p>For outdoor workouts, Hampton says <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Zon-Bright-Pink-Resistance-Tubes-Medium/14894407" target="_blank">medium-resistance tubing</a> ($8.40 Wal-Mart) works wonders. Hampton suggests tying the band to a tree for 3 sets, 12 reps of standing row arm isolations.</p>
<p>Don’t discount short, consistent, high-intensity routines.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes of sprinting can burn more calories than 20 minutes of walking!” reveals the Fit Mommy. “Any movement strengthens your heart, skeletal system and builds muscle tone. If you only have 20 minutes, get cardiovascular exercise. (It) promotes blood flow and mobilizes fat stores,” adds the exercise physiologist.</p>
<h2>Dynamic 30 minute-60 minute at-home routines:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planks:</strong> “It works your abs, back, arms and chest. Lie face down on a mat, resting yourself up on your forearms. Push off the floor, raising up onto your toes, elbows resting on the floor. Keep your back flat in a straight line from head to heels. Hold for 30-60 seconds, (then) repeat,” Cooper says.</li>
<p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/f7IuxfKFDzE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/f7IuxfKFDzE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
<li><strong>Squat-Stay:</strong> Add a twist to the classic squat by holding the seated air position for 30 seconds, once in proper form. Hampton suggests repeating 8 times.</li>
<p>
<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/xqvCmoLULNY?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/xqvCmoLULNY?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
<li><strong>Burpees:</strong> “Get into a squat..Kick your feet back into a push-up position while lowering your body to the floor. Return your feet back to the squat position. Jump! ” Cooper adds.</li>
<p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/JZQA08SlJnM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/JZQA08SlJnM?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></ul>
<p>
Outdoor circuit training can supplement cardio. “This is a set of any five exercises that you complete for 30 seconds-1 minute each before moving on to the next exercise. When you have completed each exercise once, that&#8217;s considered one circuit,&#8221; explains Cooper. Effective circuits, which should be completed at least twice up to five times, include walking lunges with knees ups, push-ups, crab walks and jumping jacks.</p>
<p>Both experts are active moms, making exercise a family affair. Cooper, who is eight months pregnant, blogs about her prenatal workouts. “Once my son is born, I plan on … using our jogging stroller at the local outdoor track.” She also plans on incorporating him into my exercises as a weight for (at home) squats.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been active lately, it is always smart to consult a doctor to cover any unanswered questions. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/010314-PushPenny-BeautyNewYear.jpg" alt="010314-PushPenny-BeautyNewYear" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-817" />Step out looking fresh and renewed this year without spending a bundle. Expert artists have rounded up the latest makeup trends for 2014 — guaranteed to keep your pockets full, while making you feel unstoppable.</p>
<p>The word this year? <strong>Focus.</strong> Professionals agree that maintaining a focal point on the face is key. Lips are taking center stage. </p>
<p>“A bold lip is always a great statement. It wakes the face up, dresses up a woman&#8217;s attire just with a swipe of a cool color. Whether it be deep red, bright orange (or) purple, a face will make a statement without going overboard,” says <a href="http://www.instagram.com/jojoblush" target="_blank">Joanna Rodriguez</a>. The New York-based makeup artist, who has worked with industry giants ranging from <a href="https://twitter.com/ladygaga" target="_blank">Lady Gaga</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/SpikeLee" target="_blank">Spike Lee</a>, favors <a href="http://www.tomford.com/#/en/beauty/cosmetics" target="_blank">TOM FORD</a> and <a href="http://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com" target="_blank">Giorgio Armani Beauty</a> for clients with limitless budgets. For price-savvy vixens, she recommends <a href="http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/c-17-lips.aspx" target="_blank">NYX Cosmetics</a>, which offers lipsticks from $6-$20.</p>
<p><a href="http://biggerfish.wix.com/pilar-freeman" target="_blank">Pilar Freeman</a>, another master artist, works with top couture fashion houses. This year, she predicts that bold lips will come with a twist. </p>
<p>“We’re looking at berry and bordeaux colors. It will be very similar to that of the <a href="http://megahairelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ombre-hair.jpg" target="_blank">ombre hairstyle</a>, where it goes from darker to lighter. We’ll see a darker (tone) in the middle and lighter around the outer area.” To usher in your own ombre, she suggests gearing up with <a href="http://bombshellbeauty.blogspot.com/2009/02/beauty-moment-loreal-hip-color-presso.html" target="_blank">L’Oreal’s HIP (High Intensity Pigment)</a>. Sold for $3.99 online, the lip stains are also available at <a href="http://www.discountcosmeticoutlet.com/product.asp?itemid=15947&amp;gclid=CKK33_j527sCFa4-Mgod7W0AOA" target="_blank">discount retailers</a>.</p>

<p>Whether lips are bold in style or color, this season they will be applied wet. Liquid lipstick in bright tones is one of the top trends this year, says <a href="http://www.amelia-c.com/">Amelia C</a>. Her Las Vegas-based makeup company works with TV productions such as TLC’s <a href="http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/what-not-to-wear" target="_blank">&#8220;What Not to Wear&#8221;</a>. </p>
<p>To keep your lips hydrated and primed for this trend, Amelia goes classic. </p>
<p>“No beauty bag is complete without <a href="http://www.target.com/p/eucerin-aquaphor-lip-repair-ointment-0-35-oz/-/A-13288300?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&amp;AFID=Google_PLA_df&amp;LNM=%7C13288300&amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty&amp;kpid=13288300&amp;LID=PA&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=13288300&amp;gclid=CNa_rNf727sCFfBcMgodKBYADA">Aquaphor</a>, for perfectly hydrated lips.”</p>
<p>The timeless trend of flawless, glowing skin will also dominate 2014. It’s all about “… wearing makeup to appear to have NO makeup on, creating a natural, groomed, healthy appearance,” Rodriguez explains. It “should start with prepping the skin by exfoliating and moisturizing. (Add) a tinted moisturizer and concealer to give the face an even, perfect canvas. (Have) groomed brows, mascara, liner applied to makeup lashes to appear fuller …(use) bronzer, peachy blush for a fresh glow. A neutral lip make(s) for a clean, fresh looking face,” she details.</p>
<p>To glow on a budget, Freeman spills the goods. “I would do the tinted moisturizer by <a href="http://www.sephora.com/tinted-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-oil-free-P140906?SKUID=1436005&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1436005&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla">Laura Mercier</a>. It’s about $42 but will last 6-8 months; and her <a href="http://www.sephora.com/secret-camouflage-P109931?SKUID=1307396&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1307396&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla">secret camouflage concealer</a>. I’d a use the <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Products/Eye-Makeup/Eye-Liner/expertwear-brow-eye-pencil.aspx">Maybelline Expertwear</a> brow pencil ($5.59).” </p>
<p>Both Freeman and Rodriguez choose <a href="http://www.target.com/p/l-oreal-voluminous-mascara/-/A-13697439">L’Oreal’s Voluminous non-waterproof mascara</a> as a bargain pick.  “It not only lengthens and thickens, but also gives you fuller lashes,” Freeman says. </p>
<p>Economical yet effective eyeliners include <a href="http://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-kohl-eyeliner-black/-/A-14653382%23prodSlot=medium_1_3&amp;term=Elf+eyeliner"> Elf</a><br />
and <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4480165">L’Oreal gel eyeliner</a>. She suggests capping off the look with a <a href="http://www.sephora.com/blush-bronzer-duo-P104006?SKUID=1479922&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=1479922&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla">Nars bronzer</a>.</p>
<p>When shopping for stellar drugstore deals, experts suggest checking the ingredients, but also educating yourself. </p>
<p>“If you can grab and go, that’s fine. But if you’re on a budget and something’s $7.99, that’s still a pretty penny for some mascara that you’re not going to be happy with. (Read) beauty blogs to see what’s trending,” Freeman adds. Also, steer clear of animal-tested products, Amelia C. says. </p>
<p>“This old-fashioned and cruel practice is alive and well… . There&#8217;s too many amazing alternatives to participate in such a devastating act.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/010314-PushPenny-WhiteSale.jpg" alt="010314-PushPenny-WhiteSale" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-810" />Do you wait for the White Sales every January to stock up on bedding and bath items? In January 1878, department store pioneer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wanamaker" target="_blank">John Wanamaker</a> created the first ever White Sale when bed linens and towels were only white. Now, the January sale has grown to mean all things, &#8220;home.&#8221; But, when it comes to bedding and bath items, watch out for deep discounts on cheap fabrics and construction and shop smart.</p>
<p>Because of the global economy, which affects textile prices and factory costs, a lot has changed in the bedding and bath departments, according to retail bed and bath buyers for today&#8217;s major department and discount stores.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what they say you need to know to shop smart at a White Sale this January:<br />
<strong>Items in a set may have changed:</strong> In the past, a standard bedding set or &#8220;comforter set&#8221; included a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, a pillow sham (two for a king size set) and a bed skirt. Today&#8217;s comforter sets often lack the bed-skirt and sometimes even the sheets but cost the same as a full set. Check the items listed in the set on the back of the package to be sure you are buying what you need.</p>
<p><strong>Microfiber is no substitute for real cotton:</strong> When cotton costs sky-rocketed a couple of years ago, many manufacturers switched to using a new fiber for sheets called pure spun microfiber. It&#8217;s a pretty name for a sheet made from 100 percent polyester and can be found on store shelves from <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com" target="_blank">Bed, Bath &#038; Beyond</a> to <a href="http://www.walmart.com" target="_blank">Wal-Mart</a>. It is very soft to the touch and much cheaper than cotton, so when cotton prices stabilized, retailers kept their microfiber sheet assortments at the lower prices, while pure cotton sheets rose in price.</p>
<p>The problem with cheaper microfiber is two-fold. First, the soft fabric is very thin resulting in fraying and splitting easily where worn. Secondly, polyester is not a natural fiber and it retains heat and dirt, making for sweaty sleeping and easier staining.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid microfiber, check the fabric designation on the back of the package. You may also find microfiber and cotton blends, which can be useful for wrinkle-resistant sheets that are cheaper than 100 percent cotton. The only time a sheet is 100 percent cotton is when it says &#8220;100 percent cotton&#8221; and lists a thread count; thread counts don&#8217;t apply to microfiber.</p>
<p><strong>The highest cotton thread counts don&#8217;t mean higher quality:</strong> Many look to the thread count of cotton bedding (how tightly woven it is) as an indicator of softness, quality and price. Cotton Percale sheets with a 180-250 thread count is the most basic high-quality weave and results in crisp, cool bed sheets. A cotton Sateen weave costs more, has a softer feel and sheen, but may wear down and pill faster. Bedding in 300 to 600 thread count cotton feels luxurious, sleeps cool, releases dirt and stains, washes well, lasts long and is priced comparatively. Thread counts beyond 600 have a tighter weave, which often results in a stiffer sheet that is not as soft to the touch as the 300 to 600 thread counts, yet has a much higher price.</p>
<p>Other, good-quality cotton choices for sheets, depending where you live and your personal sleep considerations, are soft, warm cotton jersey and cotton flannel.</p>
<p>As in a cashmere sweater, the longer cotton fibers denote a higher quality because it results in a tighter construction that feels softer and lasts longer than the shorter fibers, which release and pill easier. And, the more you wash them the softer they will get. Label designations of high quality &#8220;long-staple&#8221; cotton fibers include Pima, Supima and Egyptian cotton (check that it comes from Egypt).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for satin pillowcases, look for satin made from silk, not satin made from polyester, which will nick, pill and stain easier.</p>
<h2>Beyond the bedroom</h2>
<p><strong>Towel sizes, loops may have shrunk: </strong>The standard &#8220;bath sheet&#8221; labeled towel size should be 35 inches by 60 inches, but bath sheets in stores today may be sized 30 inches by 54 inches and cost the same as the larger counterparts, while the true bath sheet may cost more.</p>
<p>Make sure towels are 100 percent combed cotton and heavier rather than lighter for the best absorbency. Inspect the loops because towels with less loops feel scratchier and absorb less, while towels with more loops feel thicker, plusher and absorb more water. If you can see the base of the towel through the loops, look for a denser weave instead.</p>
<p>Compare towels by size and feel first, then by price.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/121313-PushPenny-WinterSavings.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-WinterSavings" width="600" height="364" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-806" />The typical American family spends at least $2,000 a year on home utility bills, and heating accounts for<br />
the biggest portion of those utility bills at 45 percent, according to the latest figures from the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever conducted a home energy audit or read through the list of tips to reduce your heating costs, you might be dismayed at the advice to replace windows or insulation in your home. While those ideas yield good returns on energy savings, they require a big outlay of money. If you&#8217;re looking for a simple, inexpensive way to quickly reduce your heating bills, consider replacing an old dial or simple digital thermostat with a new, programmable thermostat. If you have already updated your thermostat, make sure you are maximizing its use to cut your heating costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Setting back your thermostat when you are not at home for long periods of time, such as while at work all day, is one of the biggest single savings opportunities for the smallest amount money or disruption,&#8221; says Brad Paine, director of energy management systems at <a href="http://honeywell.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Honeywell</a>. &#8220;Every one degree you set it cooler for eight hours during the winter represents one percent in heating savings,&#8221; Paine advises.</p>
<p>During the winter, the Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat to 68 degrees while you&#8217;re awake, and setting it several degrees lower during the hours you are sleeping or away from home. By turning your thermostat back 10 degrees to 15 degrees for eight hours, you can save 5 percent to 15 percent per year on just your heating bill, which could be a savings of up to $135 per year.</p>
<p>Programmable thermostats are available in a wide range of prices and are easy to install for do-it-yourself-ers, Professionals are not needed, although they can be used.</p>
<p><strong>How to pick a programmable thermostat that suits your needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for a 7 day programmable thermostat, or one with a 5 day/2 day option, called 5-2. This way you can program different temperature settings for the weekdays and the weekends.</li>
<li>Look for four program periods per day, so you can have the temperature change throughout the day and night, such as lowering it in the middle of the night and raising it up just before you wake up in the morning.</li>
<li>Look for one that is back-lit or well-lit, especially if you have vision concerns.</li>
<li>If you are away from home a lot, check in to the newest versions. Many options have a corresponding Apple or Android app so you can control the thermostat from any device or home computer.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re away from home for extended periods or have a vacation home that may be empty for long periods of time, be sure you choose one with temperature swing alerts, so you can make temperature adjustments away from the home and be alerted to any possible system failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>One example is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-RTH8580WF-7Day-Touch-Thermostat/dp/B0094X6VUW" target="_blank">Honeywell Wi-Fi 7-Day Programmable Thermostat</a>, which available at <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/b/webapp/catalog/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&#038;catalogId=10053&#038;langId=-1" target="_blank">The Home Depot</a> and <a href="http://www.lowes.com" target="_blank">Lowe&#8217;s</a> and other home improvement stores and department stores for under $120. That&#8217;s mid-priced among the sea of available thermostat choices, which sell up to $349.</p>
<p>What makes this thermostat so smart is that it learns how your house reacts to weather and temperature, such as how long it takes a house to warm up and cool down, and adjusts itself accordingly. Other more expensive thermostats have touch screens, automatic weather displayed on-screen and can even send you maintenance alerts on your home&#8217;s heating and cooling system. If you have trouble with the small controls, consider a voice-activated thermostat so you can tell it exactly what you want it to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-CreditCards.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-CreditCards" width="600" height="264" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-795" />For those trying to save money and stay out of debt, the mantra is to steer clear of credit cards. <a href="http://www.beverlyharzog.com/" target="_blank">Beverly Harzog</a> disagrees. The credit card expert and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Credit-Junkie-Everything-Mistakes/dp/1601632940" target="_blank"><i>Confessions of a Credit Junkie: Everything You Need to Know to Avoid the Mistakes I Made</i></a> says that if they’re used responsibly, credit cards can be a valuable financial tool.</p>
<p>“If you understand how credit cards work and you don&#8217;t carry a balance, you can use them to make a profit as well as to build an excellent credit history,” Harzog says. “I have an airline miles card, and I use my miles to travel for free or, at the very least, at a discounted price.”</p>
<p>Consider these secrets for using credit cards to pay off debts and get free merchandise and services and you’ll soon think of credit cards as your friends.</p>
<h2>Change your credit attitude</h2>
<p>Before you embark on your journey to reaping the benefits of credit cards, Harzog suggests shifting your views regarding credit. </p>
<p>“Most people aren&#8217;t aware that their credit score impacts so many areas of their lives,” she says. “An excellent credit score helps you save money on mortgage rates, health insurance, car insurance and more. So when people say they can live without credit, they&#8217;re missing a chance to use it as a <a href="http://www.experian.com/assets/consumer-education-content/brochures/AllAboutCredit%5B1%5D.pdf" target="_blank">tool to save money</a> in many areas of their lives.”</p>
<h2>Take advantage of rewards programs</h2>
<p>Sign up for credit cards that offer rewards programs and then use the cards to pay for everyday expenses. Some cards issue free airline tickets after you spend a certain amount, while others provide points that allow you to get free merchandise and gift cards and earn cash back. Other cards give bonuses at the gas station and gift certificates for restaurants.</p>
<p>To your advantage, the credit card market is competitive. When you sign up for a new rewards card, for instance, you’ll often receive bonus points. A typical bonus for getting a new <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/05/10/travel-for-free-how-credit-card-churners-do-it" target="_blank">travel rewards credit card</a> is at least 25,000 frequent flyer miles, which immediately gets you a free trip. Those cards that give points for gift cards and cash back often offer double the points for a specific period of time after you sign up.</p>
<h2>Follow rewards program rules</h2>
<p>To get the most out of a rewards program, make sure to read the fine print, Harzog says. </p>
<p>“I understand that the fine print is very boring, but if you read it you come to understand all of the benefits of your rewards program. <a href="http://www.aba.com/Press/Documents/PERCPaperRewards.pdf" target="_blank">Credit card rewards program research</a> has shown that consumers end up wasting about one-third of their rewards, which is a shame. Be sure you track your rewards and use them, and make sure you understand the rules. Sometimes there are inactivity clauses where you lose your rewards if you don&#8217;t use the card for a specified amount of time. And if you make a late payment, you might forfeit your rewards.”</p>
<h2>Use interest rates to your advantage</h2>
<p>The best way to pay off existing credit card debt is to transfer your balance to a card that offers a zero percent introductory APR on balance transfers. If you do this, you&#8217;ll have a time period — generally from six to 12 months —in which to pay off the debt without paying any interest.</p>
<p>The break from paying interest can give you the extra leverage in interest savings that you need to get a bill paid off. For instance, if you’re currently paying $150 in interest every month on a credit card balance and switch it to a zero percent card for 12 months, you can throw an additional $1,800 at the debt over the next year.</p>
<p>It’s definitely important to spend carefully when it comes to credit, but if you make strategic moves, you can reap the benefits of hundreds and even thousands of dollars in free merchandise and services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-770" alt="121313-PushPenny-Champagne" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-Champagne.jpg" width="625" height="267" />If you&#8217;ve ever stood gape-eyed, baffled by the wine aisles at your local grocery or liquor store and asked yourself, &#8220;What&#8217;s difference between the $6 bottles, the $26 bottles and the $56 bottles?&#8221; here&#8217;s your answer.</p>
<p>Champagne is at the top of everybody&#8217;s list for holiday parties, especially for New Year&#8217;s Eve. But few really know what they are buying, according to Vinny D&#8217;Agostino, food and beverage director of <a href="http://www.kingandprince.com" target="_blank">The King and Prince Resort</a> on St. Simons Island, Ga. &#8220;Champagne <em>must</em> originate in the specific method of production using only grapes from the Champagne region of France. You will see the exact area, such as Épernay, and vineyard noted (stamped) on the label and it may include a vintage date, too,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;All others from anyplace else in the world are actually not Champagne and are instead, sparkling wine.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Why the price difference?</h2>
<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-Champagne2.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-Champagne2" width="250" height="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-772" />D&#8217;Agostino explains that those Champagnes with the area and vintage stamps on the bottle are the ones that fetch the highest prices, because the grapes are more concentrated to one vineyard and one year, and will taste the best, too. </p>
<p>One such Champagne is Moet &amp; Chandon&#8217;s best-known Dom Perignon, which usually starts around $150 but often sells for more depending on the year it was bottled. </p>
<p>Some Champagne do not contain the vintage date and are blended from a mixture of grapes from different years, which sell for around $40-$60 and which are great beginner Champagnes, he says.</p>
<p>Any bottle of sparkling wine that doesn&#8217;t specify an area or vineyard means the grapes come from a mixture of places, resulting in the lower price. </p>
<p>&#8220;A recognizable brand name is not always an indication of quality. Big names have big marketing dollars. It&#8217;s more about where the grapes come from, so always read labels.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Sweet versus dry</h2>
<p>Here are some different types of champagne designations you may see on the labels and what they mean, according to the Champagne Bureau&#8217;s U.S. office of the French trade association that represents all the grape growers and houses of Champagne, France:</p>
<p><strong>Brut:</strong> a very dry (not sweet) wine. If the letters &#8220;NV&#8221; (non-vintage) are next to it or you see no year designation, then it is usually a blend of wines from several years.</p>
<p><strong>Rosé Champagne:</strong> A slightly pinkish color, usually due to the addition of locally produced red wine or macerated black grape skins to the champagne blend. </p>
<p><strong>Special Cuvée:</strong> The word &#8220;Cuvée&#8221; means it is made from the finest, most complex wine. These can be vintage or non-vintage.</p>
<p><strong>Demi-Sec Champagne:</strong> These wines will taste sweeter than a Brut because more sugar is added during the process.</p>
<p><strong>Blanc de Blancs:</strong> This white Champagne is made exclusively from Chardonnay white grapes.</p>
<p><strong>Blanc de Noirs:</strong> This white Champagne is made exclusively from Pinot Noir/Meunier black grapes.</p>
<h2>When to splurge</h2>
<p>D&#8217;Agostino stresses that a high-quality, expensive chapagne is also no indication of the quality and there are many times when a lower-priced sparkling wine will serve your purpose better.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are serving or giving to a wine lover, expert or to people who will know the difference, buy the best you can afford. The Dom Perignon or any Moet &amp; Chandon definitely makes a statement,&#8221; D&#8217;Agostino says.</p>
<p>For large, fun parties where quantity may be more important than quality, choose less expensive varieties of sparkling wines. Some examples are Korbel from California, Freixenet from Spain, Asti from the Piemonte region in Italy and Prosecco, which originated in the Italian village of Prosecco, but is now grown in a few other parts of Italy as well. All of these are great choices that won&#8217;t bust your party budget, at around $10 a bottle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013-PushPenny-Clearance.jpg" alt="122013-PushPenny-Clearance" width="600" height="338" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-787" />Retail sales are not as good as the stores hoped they&#8217;d be this holiday season. But that&#8217;s good news for all of us clearance shoppers because there are plenty of leftovers marked down after Christmas.</p>
<p>U.S. retailers squeeked out a 2.3 percent sales gain on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, in line with <a href="http://www.shoppertrak.com" target="_blank">ShopperTrak&#8217;s</a> prediction for the weakest holiday results since 2009. The newest data from ShopperTrak shows traffic for the week ending December 22 (the biggest shopping week of the holidays) decreased 21.2 percent compared to last year and in-store sales fell 3.1 percent from the same week in 2012.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a smart clearance shopper, you&#8217;ll be on the lookout for discounts galore on these specific items right after Christmas:</p>
<h2>Holiday decorations</h2>
<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013-PushPenny-Clearance1-225x300.jpg" alt="122013-PushPenny-Clearance1" width="200" height="275" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-788" />If you noticed your holiday lights, wreaths, ornaments are wearing out (or not lighting up) or you are running low on ribbons and wrapping paper this year, the few days right after Christmas is the time to stock up on holiday necessities for next year. </p>
<p>Even if you are not in the spirit, do yourself a favor and head to the <a href="http://www.walmart.com" target="_blank">Walmart</a> and <a href="http://www.target.com" target="_blank">Target</a> holiday clearance aisles for holiday leftovers worth waiting in line for. </p>
<p><a href="http://dealnews.com" target="_blank">Dealnews.com</a>, a website that tracks sales and discounts from the previous year, recently reported holiday decorations, both <a href="http://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank">Home Depot</a> and <a href="http://www.lowes.com" target="_blank">Lowe&#8217;s</a> had particularly steep deals (up to 75 percent off) on everything holiday last year.</p>
<h2>Fashion</h2>
<p>All fall fashion footwear, accessories and apparel will be aggressively discounted as stores frantically mark down whatever&#8217;s left on the sales floor, stockrooms and warehouses to make room for new spring floor sets. </p>
<p>Watch for advertised clearance sales more than 50 percent off for the best deals. Dealnews.com reports that <a href="http://www.saksfifthavenue.com" target="_blank">Saks Fifth Avenue</a> and <a href="http://www.6pm.com" target="_blank">6pm.com</a> both offer the biggest percent-off sales of the entire year after Christmas along with no-minimum free shipping.</p>
<h2>Wine and champagne</h2>
<p>Wine, beer and champagne makers are all vying for your holiday party dollars so take advantage of these discounts up until New Year&#8217;s Day. </p>
<p>Look for wine and sparkling wine BOGO (buy-one-get-one free) or 2-fers (2 for a specified price) and pair it with manufacturer coupons whenever possible. Buy as many as the deal allows and stock up if it’s a brand you like and want to use.</p>
<h2>Maximize savings on clearance prices</h2>
<li>Always wait to pair up clearance shopping with an in-store or online coupon whenever possible.</li>
<li>Check the store&#8217;s Twitter or Facebook page and sign up for the email, text message or snail mail savings program for every retailer you shop regularly so you have lots of different types of discounts and coupons to stack on top of the clearance prices.</li>
<li>Check coupon and discount aggregator sites for on-the-spot coupon codes and even printable store coupons such as <a href="http://dealnews.com" target="_blank">Dealnews.com</a>, <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com" target="_blank">Retailmenot</a>, <a href="http://www.couponsherpa.com" target="_blank">Couponsherpa.com</a> and <a href="http://pushpenny.com" target="_blank">Pushpenny.com</a>.</li>
<li>Never go without free shipping when shopping online: Check <a href="http://www.freeshipping.org/" target="_blank">www.freeshipping.org</a> for a coupon code and check the store&#8217;s minimum spending to get it.</li>
<li>Always price-check bigger-ticket items on your smartphone or tablet using a scanner app such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redlaser-barcode-scanner-shopping/id474902001?mt=8" target="_blank">Redlaser</a> when in a store, and even when shopping online. Retailers want to attract mobile shoppers and now show different prices on different devices and often for different locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It takes a little planning and perseverance to shop this way. But why not save 50 percent or more whenever you possibly can?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-NYEParty2.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-NYEParty" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-766" />Welcoming the New Year with friends, family members and good food and drinks is a time-honored tradition. If you’re planning on welcoming in 2014 with a bang but are worried about the cost of throwing your own can’t-miss shindig, consider these tips for an inexpensive New Year’s Eve party.</p>
<h2>Send personalized evite</h2>
<p>Save money and time by sending your guests email invites, says <a href="https://twitter.com/hitheresunshine" target="_blank">Natasha Shahani</a>, learning experiences manager at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aurelianMG" target="_blank">Aurelian Marketing Group</a> in Las Vegas. “I’m a fan of <a href="http://www.paperlesspost.com" target="_blank">Paperless Post</a>, because it offers a more personalized evite than some services,” she says. “They have free options to choose from, or you can purchase coins for a really low cost to send more elaborate evites.”</p>
<h2>Be creative with entertainment</h2>
<p>Unless you have a friend or relative who plays in a band or is a professional DJ, chances are live entertainment is out of your price range. “Check out playlists on <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://www.pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora</a> or <a href="http://8tracks.com" target="_blank">8tracks</a>, or have your guests create their own playlists to share and rotate,” Shahani suggests. </p>
<p>The secret is to play music that everyone enjoys and to keep things lively. </p>
<p>Provide your guests with plenty of fun memories and something to talk about by getting a little zany. Hold a belly dancing contest, play charades or invite guests to participate in a New Year’s resolutions guessing game. Make the countdown fun by videotaping everyone as they welcome in the New Year and then show the video at next year’s party during the countdown.</p>
<h2>Edit decorations</h2>
<p>A few well-placed decorations are all you need at your New Year’s Eve celebration. “Tea light or regular candles inexpensively add a beautiful touch and create an intimate atmosphere, and string lights work well for an outside party,” Shahani says. Fresh flowers also bring a decorative touch to the occasion. She suggests finding eye-catching floral selections from a local flower market and making your own arrangements.</p>
<h2>Offer tasty finger foods</h2>
<p>Serving bite-sized, eclectic foods is a fun and affordable way to keep your guests satisfied, says Jayme O&#8217;Neil, sales and catering coordinator for <a href="http://www.californiafreshcatering.com/" target="_blank">California Fresh Catering &#038; Events</a>. “Stay away from platters of pre-made fresh appetizers, as they tend to be expensive,” she says. “Instead, opt for items like well-priced cheeses that you cut into cubes and accompany with crackers and baguettes. If you want pre-made items, opt for frozen appetizers in bulk that you can heat up. Veggie trays with a side of hummus or salsa are also affordable and popular.”</p>
<p>When it comes to the amount of food to prepare and serve, O’Neil suggests this rule of thumb: “Provide four to six bites per person per hour,” she says. “If you have 25 guests, serve five different appetizers — two meats, one seafood, one veggie and one sweet.”</p>
<h2>Use your own tableware</h2>
<p>No need to spend money on plastic dishes for your celebration when you can choose the eco-friendly option of using your own dishes and utensils. “Use your own dishware for the festivities; it’s okay if things don’t match,” says O’Neil, who suggests getting creative and honoring the holiday by serving up food in martini, margarita and shot glasses. </p>
<h2>Watch alcohol costs</h2>
<p>Alcoholic drinks are one of the most expensive considerations for your New Year’s Eve get together. Save money by buying a case of sparkling cider or champagne, suggests O’Neil, who also advises serving up a signature drink rather than providing a full bar. Do some experimenting before the big event and come up with your very own cocktail to mark the occasion. Wait until a few minutes before midnight to break out the bubbly to welcome in the New Year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-NYStyle.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-NYStyle" width="600" height="296" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-781" />An awe-inspiring outfit, sparkly tiara and attention grabbing shoes are essential components in every party girl’s New Year’s Eve toolkit. Whether you’re planning to greet 2014 in dramatic hiking boots, thigh-high platforms or strappy heels, dynamic footwear can transform your look from drab to fab!</p>
<p>“They are to my outfit what icing is to cake!” says the self-confessed pump worshipper <a href="https://twitter.com/FastInTogether" target="_blank">Tamika Sims</a>. “A good shoe is something that is cute, perhaps comfortable and can be worn with various outfits. A dynamic shoe is a shoe that has an instant &#8216;wow factor.&#8217; It makes a woman feel polished, classy-attractive and it enhances the impression of her overall look. Not all shoes can do this,” warns the creator of <a href="http://www.fastintogether.com/" target="_blank">FastInTogether.com</a>. Her practical yet savvy site highlights “fashion ideas for the chic lady on the go.”</p>
<p>As a wife and mother of two, who juggles blogging with a career in the medical field, Sims is a pro when it comes to quickly scoping out footwear deals.</p>
<p>“I love web shopping! The best thing to do is pick a couple of key shoes sites and sign up for their newsletters. My key sites are <a href="http://6pm.com/" target="_blank">6pm.com</a>, <a href="http://NineWest.com/" target="_blank">NineWest.com</a> and <a href="http://shopstyle.com/" target="_blank">ShopStyle.com</a>,” she says.</p>
<p>When it comes time to shine during the holidays, bargain hunters should have no fear slipping into designer shoes. Whether you’re hitting the town or toasting close to home, treat your pedicured paws to stylish hot-steppers for $100 or less.</p>
<p>“Sparkly pumps, pointy-toe suede booties and embellished cap-toe pumps,” are trending says the Washington D.C.-based fashion expert. “I love the pumps <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/shoes/pumpsandheels.jsp" target="_blank">J.Crew </a> has out this season. <a href="http://www.jeffreycampbellshoes.com/" target="_blank">Jeffery Campbell</a> and <a href="http://www.vincecamuto.com/shoes/" target="_blank">Vince Camuto</a> also (have) some fab picks … . Great stores to visit to get bargains on name-brand shoes are <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/nordstrom-rack" target="_blank">Nordstrom Rack</a> and <a href="http://tjmaxx.tjx.com" target="_blank">T.J. Maxx</a>.”</p>
<p>Animal prints are still in, roaring into 2014 imprinted on ankle strap pumps <a href="http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/chinese-laundry-solitare-two-piece-ankle-strap-pumps?ID=1036363&amp;CategoryID=13247&amp;RVI=Zero_2" target="_blank">(Chinese Laundry, $69.99)</a> and chunky heels<a href="http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1049573-5186157/Luichiny/Black_Leopard/Womens+E+Stella.aspx" target="_blank"> (Luichiny, $85.50)</a></p>
<p>From bow and feather embellishments to patent leather, runway designs reveal a return to feminine and classic styles in the New Year. Ignite your inner ballerina by capturing <a href="http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/bcbgeneration-persia-bow-platform-pumps?ID=1053212&amp;CategoryID=13247#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D3%26kws%3Dbow%20heels%26slotId%3D3" target="_blank">Persia bow heels for $98 </a> by BCBGeneration.</p>
<p><a href="http://r-a-wshoesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/alberto-moretti04.jpg" target="_blank">Black Swan inspired Alberto Moretti</a> show-stoppers retail for about $900. A more <a href="http://www.dsw.com/shoe/nine+west+bandeau+platform+sandal?prodId=299306&amp;_-_-all-_-NineWest-_-299306&amp;mr:trackingCode=8368E1D6-3553-E311-9917-001B2163195C&amp;mr:referralID=NA&amp;cm_mmc=affil-_-ShopStyle.com-_-1909792-_-2178999-_-DSW+Product+Catalog-_-11398186" target="_blank">economical version</a> can be found on <a href="http://www.dsw.com" target="_blank">DSW.com</a> for $99.95.</p>
<p>Fashionistas will also honor a schoolgirl staple — the patent leather Mary Jane. The sassy 2014 interpretation <a href="http://www.6pm.com/steve-madden-naia-black-patent" target="_blank">(Steve Madden, $39.98)</a> can easily transition from work to play. “I often have to balance out my desire to put on my &#8220;pow/in-your-face&#8221; pumps with what is work appropriate … . A patent leather pump in a classic and versatile color like black, nude or red, can go a long way. They are a bit more fun and snazzy than regular leather pumps and they look great with almost any work look,” Sims adds.</p>
<p>If you favor grunge over girly, rubber soles are the ticket. Step forward by flashing back to the 90s. Multicolored Doc Martens <a href="http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/dr-martens-shoes-1460-8-eye-patent-boot?ID=757388&amp;cm_mmc=Google_Mens_Shoes_Geo_PLA-_-Mens+Shoes+PLA+Sale_Mens+Shoes+PLA-_-29341283513_-_-_mkwid_LSzkpIA1_29341283513%7C-%7CLSzkpIA1" target="_blank">(Macy’s $99)</a> have returned to the marketplace. Cap toe boots are another red-hot option, pairing well with liquid leather leggings or jumpers. While Rihanna favors <a href="http://www.starstyle.com/rihanna-leaving-nobu-new-york-sp149598/" target="_blank">Balmain’s Spring 2014 quilted leather cappies ($1,840)</a>, budget-minded babes can treat themselves to a <a href="http://www.zooshoo.com/product_p/yelpstanpu.htm" target="_blank">similar style</a> for only $37. </p>
<p>Stomp into the New Year stylish and debt free, with these value finds.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It’s party season, but instead of throwing a traditional holiday soiree, “Why not start the New Year with giving back and host a party that can change the world?” says Kim Boerman, the author of &#8220;With Love: The New Generation of Party People&#8221; and the corresponding party-planning site, WithLoveParty.com. Boerman came up with the idea [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313_Parties-with-a-Purpose1.jpg" alt="121313_Parties with a Purpose1" width="600" height="277" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-756" />It’s party season, but instead of throwing a traditional holiday soiree, “Why not start the New Year with giving back and host a party that can change the world?” says Kim Boerman, the author of &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/With-Love-Generation-Party-People/dp/1482787490" target="_blank">With Love: The New Generation of Party People</a>&#8221; and the corresponding party-planning site, <a href="http://withloveparty.com" target="_blank">WithLoveParty.com</a>.</p>
<p>Boerman came up with the idea of charitable party giving after her mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and her son’s best friend all died within six months of each other, all from different causes. “I had had a successful residential real estate business, but after that, I was shell shocked. I really hadn’t dealt with a lot of death until then,” she says. Grief stricken, Boerman retreated to her back porch in Charleston, S.C., stopped working and began soul searching. She started reading a lot, too, and a fact she came across stuck with her — 53 percent of the world’s population lives on less than $2 per day. </p>
<p>Financially, Boerman wasn’t exactly flush either. “When I stopped working, things went downhill quickly,” she says, to the point that one day, she had just $10 in the bank and nothing much in her kitchen cupboards. But Boerman didn’t panic. “When I looked at my empty pantry, I thought, ‘It’s okay because my family will give with love,&#8217; ” she says. That was her ah ha moment. “Right then, I knew that was it, that love and that we take care of each other were the most important things,” she says. </p>
<p>She soon embarked on writing her charitable party-planning book and developing her WithLoveParty website, which gives party givers everything they need to host 10 themed parties that benefit 10 non-profits, including: Water Missions International, The Pajama Program, Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST), National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, UCP Wheels for Humanity, Southeastern Guide Dogs, Operation Homefront, Give Kids the World, Alex’s Lemonade Stand and Convoy of Hope.  </p>
<p>“Each charity is four-star graded through Charity Navigator and has a public service announcement that goes along with it,” Boerman says. As the hostess, you can go online to WithLoveParty.com, choose a party theme and complete the Evite which will send an electronic invitation to your guests. The site includes party activities, menu ideas and even name tags for you and your guests that can be printed on Avery labels. </p>
<p>“The site is designed so that every detail for all 10 parties are planned for you so you don’t have to plan anything,” Boerman says. It even include menus ideas and a shopping list you can print and take with you to the supermarket. </p>
<h2>Party hearty</h2>
<p>Here are two examples of the themed give-back parties Boerman suggests that might be appropriate for a New Year’s gathering:</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dreams:</strong> This pajama party benefits Children in Crisis, a program that provides pajamas for children in need in New York City. After watching a short, five-minute PSA about the organization on your TV, your pajama-wearing guests pledge at least $20 from their cell phones. “No cash is exchanged at the parties,” Boerman says. Then you make pizzas and play charades or Pictionary.    </p>
<p><strong>Let’s Roll:</strong> This Bunko party benefits Wheels for Humanity. After the guests watch the Wheels for Humanity PSA and contribute via a mobile pledging, you and your guests play Bunko, which is easy enough for kids to master. The host provides prizes for the winners. </p>
<p>Boerman’s goal is to raise $5 million dollars for 10 non-profits in a year through parties that create soulful connections and heal millions of lives throughout the world with the click of a button. To accomplish that goal, she needs 2,500 people giving parties, each with 10 attendees who donate $20, which will yield $500,000 per organization. “That’s all I need,” she says.</p>
<p>Are you game? If so, Boerman is offering her book for just $10 with the coupon code MORELOVE. The book offers discounts on party vendors across the country who she recommends to help you pull off each themed party with pizzazz. </p>
<p>&#8220;Party planning is time consuming and stressful, but it doesn’t need to be that way. With my book and website, everything is preplanned and done for you,” Boerman says. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/112913-PushPenny-TDayLeftovers.jpg" alt="112913-PushPenny-TDayLeftovers" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-749" />With presents revealed and your belly filled with all of the sumptuous fixings, Christmas is officially over! Before you start tallying up receipts or stressing out about your waistline, why not maximize your resources?</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165479/americans-holiday-spending-not-shut-down-shutdown.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup poll</a> estimated that Americans will spend nearly $800 on Christmas gifts this year. Founder of the LiveWell Movement, <a href="http://www.nwenna.com" target="_blank">Nwenna Kai</a>, has the scoop on post-present appetizers that will allow your food to stretch, while easing some of that overindulgence guilt. </p>
<p>The former Los Angeles restaurateur, who also created a line of tasty and healthy entrees for Whole Foods Market, suggests that these quick fix recipes are best served uncooked. </p>
<p>“Raw is better, simply because it’s nutrient dense … when you cook food you destroy (most of) the nutrients and vitamins,” Kai says. With Christmas being one of the prime family feasting times, there is often “… an obsession with food having to taste a certain way — being fried, overcooked and highly seasoned, because there’s a mental, emotional and spiritual attachment to food, that has to transform!” she explains.</p>
<p>Here are a few of Nwenna Kai’s simple solution recipes that can easily be repurposed from holiday leftovers:</p>
<h2>Leftover vegetables</h2>
<p><strong>Cream Kale Salad</strong><br />
Uses leftover kale, red pepper, carrots and tomatoes</p>
<p>1 avocado <br />
1 T curry powder <br />
1 T lemon juice <br />
1 handful of kale <br />
Sea salt to taste <br />
1 T olive oil  <br />
1 handful of cherry tomatoes <br />
1/2 red pepper (chopped finely) <br />
1 carrot (shredded)</p>
<p>Place the avocado, curry and lemon juice in a food processor until creamy. Massage your kale with the salt and olive oil until it is broken down. Toss your kale with the curry mixture and add in the other veggies. </p>
<p><strong>Stuffed Cucumber Sandwich</strong><br />
Uses leftover kale, avocado and cucumbers</p>
<p>1 hot house or Asian cucumber<br />
1 handful of kale <br />
8-10 black olives (pitted) <br />
1 avocado <br />
1 tablespoon flax oil  <br />
1-2 teaspoons of dulse flakes </p>
<p>Core out the meat of the cucumber. Chop up the kale and olives into fine pieces. Mash the avocado into your kale and olives. Douse with flax oil and dulse flakes. Add more dulse flakes to fit your liking. Stuff the mixture inside of the cucumber. Enjoy like a sandwich! </p>
<h2>Leftover spices</h2>
<p><strong>Persimmon Nog</strong><br />
2 cups almonds (soaked for one hour)<br />
5 large pitted dates<br />
3 cups water<br />
3 persimmons, (peeled and seeds removed)<br />
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br />
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
1 teaspoon ground ginger<br />
1 teaspoon ground cardamom<br />
1 vanilla bean<br />
1 banana (to add to the thickness)</p>
<p>Use a Vitamix (or any other strong/professional grade) blender to mix the almonds, dates, and water until creamy and smooth. Strain the liquid through a cheesecloth or strainer. Pour the almond milk back into the blender. Add in the persimmons, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, vanilla bean and banana. </p>
<h2>Leftover nuts</h2>
<p><strong>Amazing Mac &#038; Sweet Cashew Cheese</strong><br />
For the Cashew Cheese:<br />
3 cups cashews, (soaked for two hours and drained)<br />
1/4 cup nutritional yeast<br />
2 cloves garlic<br />
2 cups water<br />
Sea salt to taste</p>
<p>4 cups coconut meat (sliced as noodles) or kelp noodles<br />
1/2 cup of ground walnuts (optional; to act as bread crumbs)</p>
<p>Place all of the cashew cheese ingredients, except for the water, in a Vitamix (or any other strong/professional grade) blender. Mix well. Lift the plastic cap of the blender and slowly pour in the water until the texture becomes creamy and whiter in color. Add the cashew cheese to the noodles of your choice. Sprinkle the ground walnuts on top. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-Electronics.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-Electronics" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-743" />Christmas Day is finally here. If you’ve just unwrapped a shiny new electronic device from Santa, don’t toss your old model into a desk drawer or a closet. Instead, cash it in as soon as you can.</p>
<p>“There’s a huge market for used electronic devices domestically and overseas,” says Nik Raman, co-founder and COO of <a href="http://www.usell.com">uSell.com</a>, the only online “recommerce” marketplace for used gadgets. If you’re like 51 percent of consumers, you have up to five old-model gadgets, just sitting around, according to a recent uSell.com survey. “We recommend that consumers trade in immediately,” Raman says. “Newer models are going to get the highest price.”</p>
<p>USell.com doesn’t buy your device from you and give you cash. Instead, it connects sellers who want to get instant quotes on the value of their electronic device, with a diversity of businesses that specialize in purchasing mobile devices, such as insurance companies that supply customers who break their phone with a refurbished phone as a replacement. Your old phone could end up in a brick and mortar store or on Amazon. “Old devices end up all over the world and all over the country,” Raman says. In any event, uSell.com makes it easy to sell your device and move on. “We monitor the logistics and the transactions so that consumers get paid quickly and accurately,” Raman says. </p>
<h2>Talkin’ Money</h2>
<p>IPhones garner 40 percent of uSell.com’s business volume. “As a rule, the value of an iPhone depreciates 5 percent per month,” Raman says. Whatever model you have will be worth 55 percent of what it was a year ago. Right now, an iPhone 5 or an iPad 3, for example, will net $210 each on the resale market. Don’t worry if your device is damaged. It’s still worth something. An iPhone 5 with a cracked screen, for example, will get you about $120. </p>
<p>You can get something for older models too. An iPhone 4S is going for about $115 on the resale market right now and you’ll get about $40 for iPhone 4. Still, that’s better than nothing. </p>
<p>When you buy a new device, “get in the habit of getting some cash for your old device as soon as you load your data onto your new device,” Raman says. Besides Apple products, including iPods, there’s a decent resale market for Samsung products, such as the Galaxy Note series and the Galaxy S series, on Usell.com. “We also have a decent amount of volume for handheld gaming consoles, such as Nintento DSis and Sony Playstation PSPs,” Raman says. Older model Blackberry phones are still in demand, too.</p>
<p>When selling your used device, make sure you’re turning in the correct model. For example, “don’t send in an iPhone 4 and call it a 4S,” which is a mistake some consumers make, Raman says. The buyer will have to send you a revised offer. If you change your mind about selling before the deal is done or reject the offer you receive, “you always have the chance to get your device back,” Raman says.</p>
<p>To start the process, do your research on uSell.com to see how much your device is worth. Then, uSell.com sends sellers a kit. You’ll just drop your device in the kit and put it in the mailbox. After you send off your gadget and it’s inspected, uSell.com’s third-party vetted buyers will pay you within five business days, either by check or PayPal. uSell.com handles all communication between sellers and buyers. A buyer rating system on the site with online reviews can help you know who you’re dealing with. </p>
<p>“The benefit of working through us is that we can monitor the transaction, make sure it goes smoothly, and if you have any issues, you can reach out to our customer service department,” Raman says. “It’s a lot safer and less work and hassle than trying to sell your device yourself.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can buy great fashion and great gifts and still have it &#8220;mean something.&#8221; There&#8217;s a new marketing term for this called Guilt-Free Consumption, dreamt up by the folks at <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com" target="_blank">TrendWatching.com</a> who coined the phrase for marketers. Guilt-Free Consumption refers to consumers who want to shop, live and eat without worrying about negative impacts on the world, such as poor working and humanitarian conditions, eating or wearing animal-based products, doing things that are unhealthy for our bodies, the sick, disabled and disadvantaged, environmental and waste concerns along with carbon footprint and just the overall vast commercialization of the holidays.</p>
<p>Here is a short list of some of the web&#8217;s most meaningful gift ideas from companies that pledge to make a difference:</p>
<h2>For outdoorsmen </h2>
<p>If your main mantra is reduce, reuse, recycle, join Patagonia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/common-threads/">Common Threads Partnership</a>. When you buy and give Patagonia, you&#8217;re getting high-quality gear made purposely to last a long time. If your gift needs repair, they will repair it. Patagonia will help find used Patagonia gear a new home and they will even take back worn out gear and recycle it to keep it out of landfills.</p>
<h2>For indoorsman </h2>
<p>If the cause near and dear to your heart is children or cancer, consider that Dell purchases support <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/childrens-cancer-care" target="_blank">Dell&#8217;s Children’s Cancer Care</a>. The Texas-based company has committed millions of dollars and its tech skills to help children fight cancer. In addition, Dell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/cr-earth-reduce-reuse-recycle">zero-waste initiative</a> reports that its global manufacturing and fulfillment facilities maintain a high recycle and reuse rate of about 98 percent of nonhazardous solid waste.</p>
<h2>For the woman who has everything</h2>
<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/2013/12/24/732/121313-pushpenny-guiltfreeshopping/" rel="attachment wp-att-739"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-GuiltFreeShopping.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-GuiltFreeShopping" width="218" height="600" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-739" /></a>With 24 ways and counting to style and wear <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/metamorph-dress-by-thieves">The METAmorph Dress</a> ($84-$100), it is the perfect fit for many body types and is created using a sustainable closed loop production process with a ultra soft, luxurious bamboo fabric. Besides funding production and supporting local and sustainable design, a portion of funds from the sale of each dress color corresponds with an organization that helps fund a more sustainable future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black: Free the children</li>
<li>Beige: Kiva</li>
<li>Grey: CharityWater</li>
<li>Raspberry: GiveDirectly</li>
<li>Teal: David Suzuki foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.toryburch.com/accessories/tory-burch-foundation/?CAMPID=TBFShop">Tory Burch Foundation sunglasses, bracelet or agenda </a>are thoughtful ideas for super-stylish women ($95-$149). All proceeds from the purchase of these classic Tory Burch sunglasses, a double wrap studded bracelet or the leather-bound agenda go to support the economic empowerment of women and families through the Tory Burch Foundation.</p>
<h2>Meaningful stocking stuffers under $25 </h2>
<p>Want to feel better about buying kids a gift card to Mcdonald&#8217;s or Burger King (because they will love you for it)? Burger King recently launched <a href="http://www.bk.com/en/us/company-info/news-press/detail/burger-king-introduces-new-satisfriestm-great-tasting-crinkle-cut-reduced-fat1-2893.html">Satisfries</a> — French fries with 40 percent less fat and 30 percent fewer calories than the McDonald&#8217;s equivalent. And McDonald’s <a href="http://news.mcdonalds.com/Corporate/news-stories/Alliance-for-a-Healthier-Generation-and-McDonald%E2%80%99s">announced a global partnership</a> with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to make specific commitments, including always offering a choice of a side-salad, fruit or vegetables as a substitute for fries in a value meal.</p>
<p>All of the profits of <a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Shop%20for%20a%20Cause_Shop%20For%20A%20Cause%20Lip%20Glac%C3%A9_prod750006">Laura Mercier Shop for a Cause Lip Glacé</a> in kiss of hope (peach) or rose hope (pink) limited-edition lip gloss ($24) will be donated to the Laura Mercier Ovarian Cancer Fund.</p>
<p>Vegan and made with fair trade and organic cocoa butter, ylang ylang and geranium, LUSH donates 100 percent of the price of the sale of each <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Lush-Site/en_US/Charities-Support">LUSH Charity Pot</a> body lotion ($22.95) to support worthy causes: In five years, Charity Pot has funded donations to more than 350 worldwide animal welfare, humanitarian and environmental charities. </p>
<p>Through proceeds of the sale of each <a href="http://www.philosophy.com/graceful-journey/graceful-journey,en_US,pg.html">Philosophy Graceful Journey gift set</a> which includes pure grace shampoo, bath and shower gel and seven inspirational cards ($25), Philosophy has partnered with <a href="http://lookgoodfeelbetter.org" target="_blank">Look Good Feel Better</a>, which helps cancer patients deal with the appearance-related side effects of cancer treatment through in-person group workshops.</p>
<h2>Online shops where everything you buy gives back</h2>
<p><a href="https://givengoods.co/how-it-works/">Given Goods</a> is an online marketplace for home decor, kitchen, bath, handbags and accessories where products make a tangible social impact every time an item is purchased. Each product has a story and the website shows how the product gives back. Free shipping is available on orders that total more than $100.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shopforsocial.com/">Shop For Social</a> partners with and curates products exclusively from local social enterprises and nonprofits, and includes handicrafts made by physically handicapped or disadvantaged individuals. Items start at $1. </p>
<p>You probably know that when you buy a pair of TOMS shoes, the company donates a pair of shoes. The same holds true for the new eyewear line, too, except instead of shoes it gives a pair of prescription glasses, a sight-saving surgery or a medical treatment via the Seva Foundation. This year, TOMS launched <a href="http://www.toms.com/marketplace" target="_blank">The Marketplace</a>, which curates products from sustainable and socially conscious companies and you can shop by cause.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-735" alt="122013-PushPenny-LastMinuteGifts" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013-PushPenny-LastMinuteGifts.jpg" width="600" height="262" />If you still have not completed your holiday shopping, you&#8217;ll have no choice but to go out to a local store. Whether you need something cute, crafty, kitschy, cutting edge or if you don&#8217;t know what you need, the best place to find it is at a large, multi-department off-price retailer such as <a href="http://www.rossstores.com" target="_blank">Ross</a>, <a href="http://tjmaxx.tjx.com" target="_blank">T.J. Maxx</a> and <a href="http://www.marshallsonline.com" target="_blank">Marshalls</a>. These brick-and-mortar shops contain a treasure trove of high-quality, brand-name (but also a lot of low-quality and cheap) gift ideas for any member of the family.</p>
<h2>Every type of gift possible</h2>
<p>These are mini department stores that have every type of gift, which is especially helpful when you don&#8217;t know what to get. Just wander among the departments to find presents for everyone on your list: tech accessories, gift sets, toys, designer apparel and footwear, designer fragrances, watches, sunglasses, jewelry, designer handbags, slippers, pajamas, bathrobes, wall art, books, crafts, furniture, luggage, workout gear, underwear, skincare, personal care products and appliances, cookware, food, kitchenware, kitchen appliances, gadgets and more. The one-stop shopping options also sell gift wrap, ribbon and cards, which you may need if you&#8217;re that late on your holiday shopping.</p>
<h2>Lots of brand names</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vickyoliver" target="_blank">Vicky Oliver</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Millionaires-Handbook-Millionaire-Youre/dp/1616084146" target="_blank">&#8220;The Millionaire&#8217;s Handbook,&#8221;</a> says that in order to score finds at these stores you need to know your brands and you should also know the difference between high-quality and a low-quality items in apparel, footwear and fashion accessories.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, manufacturers create specific lines for sale for the off-price retailers and they are not true close-outs, meaning they are not random designer leftovers of high-quality items from department stores such as <a href="http://www.neimanmarcus.com" target="_blank">Neiman Marcus</a>, <a href="http://www.lordandtaylor.com" target="_blank">Lord &amp; Taylor</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomingdales.com" target="_blank">Bloomingdale&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com" target="_blank">Nordstrom</a>,&#8221; Oliver explains. &#8220;It may not be the same fabric, fit, finish or styling you might have found in the upscale department stores for two or three times the price, so you have to check out the item carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if you do know your brands and what to expect from them, whether skincare, toys, shoes, athletic footwear, activewear or women&#8217;s or men&#8217;s apparel, you can scoop up some great brand-name and designer deals. Here are some of the lines you can find at the off-price retailer shops:</p>
<h3>Apparel &amp; Footwear</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coach</li>
<li>Ugg</li>
<li>Michael Kors</li>
<li>L.A.M.B.</li>
<li>Tahari</li>
<li>Jones New York</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fossil</li>
<li>Micheal Kors</li>
<li>Calvin Klein</li>
<li>Betsey Johnson</li>
<li>Ralph Lauren</li>
</ul>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nike</li>
<li>Adidas</li>
<li>Asics</li>
<li>Under Armour</li>
<li>Columbia Sportswear</li>
<li>Patagonia</li>
<li>Merrell</li>
<li>Minnetonka</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skin and hair</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chi</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Bliss</li>
</ul>
<h3>Toys</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melissa &amp; Doug</li>
<li>Fisher Price</li>
<li>KidKraft</li>
<li>Madame Alexander dolls</li>
<li>Wonderworld</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cuisinart</li>
<li>KitchenAid</li>
<li>Keurig</li>
<li>Wusthof</li>
</ul>
<h2>Off-beat unique choices</h2>
<p>If you like to give unique gifts that are not straight off the shelf from Macy&#8217;s, these off-price retailers are the stores to find items for grandma who loves metal chickens, an aunt who collects mirrored elephant figurines and a niece who can use an interesting jewelry box. Ross says on its website that it does not buy the same merchandise for all stores, so you can shop two Ross stores in the same town for a different selection. Also, between T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, their merchandise also differs regionally and they receive shipments many times per week.</p>
<h2>Lower prices</h2>
<p>Prices may often be lower for similar items compared to what is currently in Macy&#8217;s and Nordstrom. But when it comes to low prices, Oliver says watch out especially for no-name, private label outlet and off-price handbags, apparel and footwear, and to stick with the name brands if possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skip the cheap chic bargain basement finds because they are probably no bargain at all and will fray and fall apart faster than you can say &#8216;happy holidays.&#8217;&#8221; She says to read labels for fabrications, examine stitching and workmanship and double check sizes and items in a set to get the most for your money.</p>
<p>One problem with shopping at these stores: Don&#8217;t stray from your list, or you&#8217;ll find yourself overspending on items for yourself!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/112913-PushPenny-Vintage1.jpg" alt="112913-PushPenny-Vintage1" width="600" height="265" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-722" />Whether you’re punching up your style for a holiday office party or a New Year’s night on the town, close this year out properly! Arrive looking like a lady of luxury on a dime. Vintage styling is the key to making your caviar dreams come true. </p>
<p>Retro fashion is in vogue: skirts that flutter, shiney pearls, elegant gloves, cocktail rings, bold prints and decadent hats. Before you rewind a few decades, make sure that it’s real. “… A close look at the fabric content and brand label, the construction, will ensure you are purchasing an authentic vintage item and not a more recent item that is simply vintage-inspired,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryKincaid" target="_blank">Mary Kincaid</a>.<img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/112913-PushPenny-Vintage2.jpg" alt="112913-PushPenny-Vintage2" width="200" height="336" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-723" /> The founder of <a href="http://zuburbia.com" target="_blank">Zuburbia.com</a>, an eco-conscious purveyor of period wear, suggests newbies should do their homework. “There are unscrupulous sellers who will sometimes switch tags or cut tags out entirely and claim that an item is vintage.” Confirm that you’re buying from a reputable distributor by sourcing <a href="http://www.vintagefashionguild.org" target="_blank">VintageFashionGuild.org</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified a viable shop to purchase your threads, stay true to the mission. Don’t fall victim to investing in designer vintage, which is often more expensive than modern name brands. Kincaid, who curates and posts “<a href="http://www.zuburbia.com/blog" target="_blank">eBay Vintage Roundups</a>,” an online tag sale of vintage finds, encourages shopping smart. How do you run with the affluent set without investing like one? </p>
<h2>Tip 1: Don’t be a label snob</h2>
<p>If you plan to splurge on one item, go for a timeless coat or Hermes scarf. But if you’re interested in a complete look, “… bypass the pricey and in-demand designer labels and seek out the often very well-made clothes by lesser-known designers and manufacturers,” Kincaid says. </p>
<h2>Tip 2: Do NOT shop around</h2>
<p>Making quick decisions when buying vintage is crucial. Most pieces are one of a kind — back stock is rare. “If you try to shop around, there&#8217;s a good chance the first piece will be gone when you return to purchase it. If you are shopping for a special day or big event, start early. Shopping for vintage isn&#8217;t going to be as easy as walking into a large department store and finding something at the last minute,” the personal shopper advises.</p>
<h2>Tip 3: Widen your scope</h2>
<p>Venture beyond your neighborhood boutique. Kincaid favors estate sales, local auctions, charity sales, Craigslist ads, websites, as well as eBay. &#8220;Don&#8217;t overlook your local Goodwill store,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Some of my all-time favorite vintage pieces came from there.”</p>
<h2>Tip 4: Mix and match</h2>
<p>Retro-themed TV shows such as <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men" target="_blank">Mad Men</a> and <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire" target="_blank">Boardwalk Empire</a> have boosted interest in vintage fashion. “Flapper styles of the 1920s and early 1930s have been very popular. With fashion today, though, pieces from all decades can be combined and styled with modern pieces to look current,” notes the expert. Vintage hair clips, opulent costume rings or jeweled brooches can add <a href="http://zuburbia.com/blog/2013/11/28/just-jewelry-ebay-vintage-jewelry-auctions-70/" target="_blank">spunky accents</a> to modern dresses and blazers. But beware of fully embracing your inner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Harlow" target="_blank">Jean Harlow</a>. “Avoid wearing vintage from head-to-toe. The look is too costume …. If you&#8217;re wearing a modern cocktail dress, add unique flair with vintage jewelry, a vintage handbag or a knock-out pair of vintage heels. If you&#8217;re wearing a vintage suit or dress, then pair it with contemporary or trendy shoes, jewelry or other accessories,” she advises. </p>
<p>With all of the potential pairing, budget-friendly options are endless. Start with retro essentials that can carry you from an office soiree to the after-party. Beaded sweaters, satin camisoles, sleek cigarette pants, capes and pencil skirts can be found for under $150.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-GiftCards.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-GiftCards" width="600" height="265" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-717" />For the 7th year in a row, gift cards are the most requested holiday gift, according to the <a href="http://www.nrf.com" target="_blank">National Retail Federation</a>. Because gift cards allow you to choose your own present, it’s hard to go wrong. Still, what if you get a gift card for a merchant you rarely frequent? Or, what if you’d really rather have the cash to help pay down your Christmas debt?</p>
<p>There’s no time like the present to turn your plastic into cash through the secondary gift card market. </p>
<p>“Right after Christmas is a good time to sell your gift cards because reseller inventory is at an all-time low,” says Kendal Perez, a spokeswoman for <a href="http://www.giftcardgranny.com" target="_blank">www.giftcardgranny.com</a>, an online exchange that lists bids from the top gift card companies to easily identify the best price.</p>
<p>GiftCardGranny represents gift card sellers with an inventory of about 50,000 discount gift cards. “At least we did three months ago,” Perez says. “Now, we’re down to half that because people have been buying gift cards like mad.”<br />
The average return on a gift card is 75 percent of its value. But if you sell a gift card soon after Christmas, you’re likely to do even better than that, Perez says. After the holidays, resellers need to rebuild their inventory.</p>
<p>One website, <a href="http://www.giftcardexchangeday.com" target="_blank">GiftCardExchangeDay.com</a>, is promoting Dec. 26 as a one-day event to provide instant bids on unwanted or unused gift cards from resellers. </p>
<p>By selling a gift card sooner rather than later, you’re also less likely to lose track of it. As a result of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which was signed into law in May 2009, consumers can hold onto gift cards for 5 years before fees kick in that slowly erode a gift card’s value. But not using a gift card immediately increases the chances you’ll lose or misplace it. “Each year $1.8 billion in gift cards go unused,” Perez says. If you don’t plan on using a gift card, resell it as soon as possible so you can pocket the cash. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p><strong>Check the balance:</strong> Once you decide to sell your card, verify the balance on the gift card first. You can sell both unused and partially used gift cards for cash, but companies need to know the true balance of the card to pay you for it. You can usually check the balance on the company&#8217;s website or by calling the customer service department listed on the back of the card.</p>
<p><strong>Get the best offer.</strong> There are a dozen or so reputable gift card companies that will buy your card for cash. However, each will offer you a different amount for your card, so shop around to make sure you&#8217;re getting the best deal. “At GiftCardGranny.com, we don’t buy your card and give you cash,” Perez says. The portal allows you to easily comparison shop and vets gift card resellers so you know you’re dealing with reputable dealers.</p>
<p><strong>Decide on payment.</strong> Most gift card companies offer you payment in the form of a check, but receiving funds via PayPal or an Amazon gift card may also be an option. If you trade your gift card for an Amazon gift card, you typically get 4.5 percent to 5 percent more than if you opt for cash, Perez says. Some cards are worth more in the resale market because they’re more in demand. Target and Wal-Mart gift cards will often net 90 percent of their value because consumers can buy basically anything at these retailers.</p>
<p>You may only get 50 percent to 60 percent of a gift card’s value if it’s for a regional restaurant or retailers that isn’t as popular. Still, it’s better than nothing, especially if the gift card is for a restaurant or retailer you don’t really like.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget:</strong> Besides selling your gift cards, you can also buy discount gift cards through GiftCardGranny.com, too. “About 90 percent of the resellers we work with have a cash-back guarantee,” Perez says. That means that if you’re buying a gift card and it doesn’t have the balance that was advertised, you get your money back in full.</p>

Scratching your head over what to buy your guy for the holidays? We’ve compiled a stress-free gift guide with the hottest items for the man of the house. Before you grab your Santa hat, here are a few tips from Brigitte Segura, creator and editor of <a href="http://fashiondailymag.com/category/fdm-boys-club/" target="_blank">Fashion Daily Mag-Boys Club</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stick to the basic categories: clothing, fragrances, grooming or gadgets. “Men are simple beings — no matter how picky they are.”</li>
<li>Don’t entertain pieces that may be too fashion forward. “… Don&#8217;t try to give them a makeover, they won&#8217;t wear it,&#8221; Segura says. &#8220;Guys need to ease into a new category or color.”</li>
<li>Take time to do some research. “Don’t buy gadgets without doing your homework. Guys like to ‘own’ that domain,” Segura suggests. Don’t invest in pants or shoes if you’re not privy to the brand’s fit.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a fail-proof guideline in tow, we conducted a diverse sampling of men, ages 23-43 for the top items on their wish list, priced for $100 or less:</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>SONY has stepped up its game by creating the <a href="http://store.sony.com/black-4gb-walkman-sports-mp3-player-zid27-NWZW273//cat-27-catid-All-Players-Docks" target="_blank">4GB Walkman Sports Underwater MP3 Player</a> ($79.99). “This would be great when I swim at the gym,” says Jose Tankersly, a welder from Philadelphia. The lightweight wireless gadget will allow your Michael Phelps to listen to his favorite tunes while diving down to 6 feet. He can download 900 songs onto the device, which can run for up to 8 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zensah.com/men/men-accessories/running-gloves.html" target="_blank">Zensah Running Gloves</a> ($29.99) are another tech-savvy treat. If you’ve ever had to put off sending a text or an email because it was too cold outside to use your smartphone, this gift is ideal. “It sucks to take off your gloves when you walk to school in order to make a call,” says student Geoffrey Spencer. These gloves are not only warm, but have built in traction, allowing your man to easily use his smartphone. They’re also stamped with reflectors for nighttime runners.</p>
<h2>Clothes</h2>
<p>Saying yes to a cozy cardigan and no to that reindeer knitted Christmas sweater is key. But “the most practical things remain: underwear, ties and socks….(they) can never get enough,” Segura explains. University of Louisville dental student Ira Hill agrees. He hopes that Santa delivers thermal underwear (<a href="http://www.hanes.com/clothing/men/thermal-underwear" target="_blank">Hanes</a>, $6-$32) and basketball warm-up pants (<a href="http://www.basketballexpress.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=21982&amp;code=BSKTBWEBKAGM6001&amp;cm_mmc=Google_Base-_-Basketball-_-Products%20Link-_-475513&amp;kwid=productads-sku%5E436633WWM-adtype%5EPLA-device%5Ec-site%5Ebasketballexpress-adid%5E17608363268" target="_blank">Nike</a>, $64.99). Since he is a man on the go, these items are basic necessities and are &#8220;a beautiful merger between form meeting function.” Silk boxers and wool socks (hopefully not paired together) are also top requests. <a href="http://www.bonobos.com/b/accessories-for-men" target="_blank">Bonobos</a> is a great resource for stylish, economical accessories.</p>
<h2>Watches</h2>
<p>“Every man should own a few nice watches. Jewelry is not necessary, but nice timepieces add a touch of class and sophistication,” says Ricardo Sears, a New Jersey-based ambulance technician. If you’re unable to shell out $300 for <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/guide-to-galaxy-smart-devices/galaxy-gear.html" target="_blank">Galaxy’s Note 3 + Gear</a>, one of the most sought after items trending for guys, hunt for sales on dependable brands such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_36_1?rh=n%3A377110011%2Ck%3Ainvicta+watch%2Cp_36%3A386701011&amp;bbn=377110011&amp;keywords=invicta+watch&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386958093&amp;rnid=386698011%22%3Ehttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_36_1?rh=n%3A377110011%2Ck%3Ainvicta+watch%2Cp_36%3A386701011&amp;bbn=377110011&amp;keywords=invicta+watch&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1386958093&amp;rnid=386698011" target="_blank">Invicta</a>. With pieces ranging from $52-100, designs range from classic to vintage to surf.</p>
<h2>Grooming</h2>
<p>Know your guy’s regimen when it comes to grooming. “If the guy uses shaving foam, he&#8217;s not going to use a fancy shave kit,” Segura says. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Andis-T-Outliner-Trimmer-T-Blade-04710/dp/B000143C0K" target="_blank">Andis T-Outliner Trimmer</a> ($47.89) is popular in the barbering world. It is “… not too over the top … (and it) enhances sharpness,” explains Lewis Jones, a travel agent in Maryland. Jetsetters will appreciate <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/the-art-of-shaving-the-4-elements-of-the-perfect-shave-starter-kit/3351130?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=544&amp;cm_sp=personalizedsort-_-searchresults-_-1_2_B" target="_blank">The Art Of Shaving: The 4 Elements of the Perfect Shave</a> ($25). The starter kit takes up little room in the luggage, allowing Mr. Wonderful to “prep, lather, shave, (and) moisturize, all in one complete bundle,” Segura adds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-Volunteering.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-Volunteering" width="600" height="464" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-707" />In addition to making you and those you help feel good, volunteering to assist the less fortunate produces some unexpected benefits, including boosting your finances. Consider how donating your time and talents has a way of giving back to you.</p>
<h2>Tax breaks</h2>
<p>Many of the unreimbursed expenses you incur while volunteering can be written off on your taxes. Such expenses include travel costs that allow you to get to and from volunteer locations. Write off train, bus and plane fees, gas, tolls and parking. You can even deduct travel expenses to an out-of-town location, such as a convention, providing you attend for charitable, not personal, reasons. And if your charitable work requires a uniform, you can write off the cost of the outfit. For more tax tips, read <a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/2013/11/21/start-preparing-for-tax-season-now/" title="Start preparing for tax season now" target="_blank">Start preparing for tax season now</a></p>
<h2>Learning/training opportunities</h2>
<p>The skills you develop while volunteering may help you advance in your day job or give you necessary experience to climb the corporate ladder. Volunteering can provide a variety of marketable job skills, including fundraising, marketing, planning and leading. You’ll earn educational experience and valuable on-the-job training.</p>
<h2>Career guidance</h2>
<p>If you haven’t yet found the ideal job, volunteering can offer you the chance to try various roles within an organization. Experiencing different facets of a company will help you choose the ideal career path that leads to a job you love — and a good salary.</p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>The contacts you gather when volunteering can lead to an impressive roster of individuals who are happy to help when you call seeking employment or business opportunities. If you would like to work in a particular field, volunteer at an organization that specializes in that industry so you gain access to the key players in that realm. Those relationships you develop during service can prove to be long-lasting and mutually beneficial.</p>
<h2>Improved productivity</h2>
<p>There is a direct link between the emotional well-being you experience helping others and your desire to tackle your own projects. “Our research shows that not only does giving to others lead to happiness for people all over the world — from Canada to Uganda to South Africa – but giving time has another unusual benefit: it actually makes you feel less stressed about your own time,” says <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=326229" target="_blank">Michael I. Norton</a>, an associate professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and co-author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Money-Science-Smarter-Spending/dp/1451665067" target="_blank">Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</a></em>. “In several studies, we have shown that when people volunteer and help others, the feelings of accomplishment that they experience (‘I really helped someone!’) make them feel that they are better able to get their own tasks done (‘I’m on a roll!’),” Norton says.</p>
<h2>Help you stand out and get a job</h2>
<p>Volunteer work on your resume helps you stand above the crowd and get noticed. Hiring managers tend to be impressed with a person’s dedication to help others and often consider this a sign that you’re a self-starter who will go the extra mile. Because many potential employers highly value non-profit experience, your commitment and generosity is likely to make you a strong contender for any job for which you apply.</p>
<h2>Improves your health and well-being</h2>
<p>Studies show that volunteering can lead to better health, which means that you will likely have fewer medical expenses. The physical and mental rewards associated with volunteering are many, including reduced stress, improved moods and emotions and strengthening of the immune system.</p>
<h2>Opens you to receiving</h2>
<p>Giving isn’t done in a vacuum. Once you reach out to help, you initiate a natural give-and-take process between you and the world that allows you to receive the many good things likely to come your way, including financial fitness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121313-PushPenny-TwitterSavings.jpg" alt="121313-PushPenny-TwitterSavings" width="600" height="111" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-712" /><br />
If you’ve ever “liked” a company on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to get exclusive coupons and deals, you know that social media is a marketing frontier. Online deals represented $35 billion in the U.S. in the last quarter of 2013, says <a href="https://twitter.com/bernieperrine" target="_blank">Bernard Perrine</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.hiplogiq.com" target="_blank">HipLogiq</a>, a marketing software company based in Dallas that helps retailers find customers on <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. In fact, Twitter is now getting in on the action by vying for your consumer dollars. </p>
<p>“Half of all Twitter users have already purchased a product or service because of Twitter,” Perrine says. “There are lots of coupons and deals on Twitter waiting to be snatched up.”</p>
<p>Twitter is a more public forum than Facebook, which makes it a marketer’s dream. It allows retailers the potential of reaching a much larger audience. “The community is more willing to participate in conversations that can spark offers and discounts, such as “Looking for a good place for dinner on Saturday night,” Perrine says. </p>
<p>Working through a software marketing firm such as HipLogiq, which uses a patented algorithm to target key words and filter conversations, retailers can maximize their efforts and start listening in real time to what potential customers are looking for and then tweet back directly with discounts or offers. </p>
<h2>Tweeting tips</h2>
<p>Although Perrine is in the business of coaching retailers on how to find customers on Twitter by mining their public profiles, he offers this advise for consumers on how to use Twitter to get in on deals and coupons.</p>
<p><b>Share your life events.</b> Having a baby? Planning your next vacation? Getting your haircut? Heading to lunch? Put it out there on Twitter. You’re more likely to get offers from companies if you share your daily activities, especially if they’re related to travel and leisure (airlines, resorts, golf and tennis), health and beauty (spas, hair stylists, mani/pedis), restaurants or health and wellness, which are the industries generating the most deal “traffic.” </p>
<p>Ask your followers “Where to go for spring break?” as part of your 140 character message and you’re likely to get discounts on hotels and flights to Mexico. “The <a href="http://www.visitmexico.com" target="_blank">department of tourism in Mexico</a> is one of our clients and they’re trying to incentivize people to come to Mexico,” Perrine says. </p>
<p><strong>Include your geographic area in your tweets.</strong> If you’re visiting Dallas and you’re looking for a great coffee bar, mention your location so local retailers can find you. For example, you might tweet something like: “Anyone know where to great coffee in Plano?” You&#8217;ll probably get suggestions from your social media followers who are familiar with Plano. You’re also bound to get coupons from local coffee shops. “Retailers who are anticipating that sort of tweet will find you and respond with a personalized @reply Tweet,” Perrine says. </p>
<p><strong>Spread the word.</strong> If you get a deal on Twitter, you might be asked to pass the offer onto your pals. By all means, do it. If you send three of your friends a coupon offer through Twitter for $1 off a cup of <a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html" target="_blank">Dunkin&#8217; Donuts</a> coffee, for example, and they redeem it, you might get another perk as well, such as a free cup of coffee. Companies such as Hiplogiq are in the business of helping companies make their offers and deals viral.</p>
<p><strong>Be specific.</strong> If you’re interested in getting a deal on a product that isn’t geographically bound, for example, hone your tweet to include the brands you’re looking for to narrow the focus of the responses you receive. Try this tweet if you are hunting for electronics for a Christmas present: “Deciding between an iPad and the Surface for my teenage son. Help!” Besides buying advice from your followers, you might also get a discount code for a tablet computer from a major retailer, such as <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>. “Retailers aren’t necessarily reserving some deals for Twitter users, but they are giving more targeted deals so you don’t have to hunt through a forest of offers on the Internet,” Perrine says. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-Cashmere2.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-Cashmere2" width="600" height="267" class="alignright size-full wp-image-647" />Fast-fashion doesn&#8217;t apply to cashmere sweaters. &#8220;A high-quality cashmere sweater is meant to last a lifetime. It should get softer and more form-fitting with age and wear,&#8221; says Karl Spilhouse, president of the <a href="http://www.cashmere.org/cm/index.php" target="_blank">Cashmere and Camel Hair Manufacturer&#8217;s Institute</a>.</p>
<p>He says there are no bargains in cashmere because it a very expensive raw material. </p>
<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-Cashmere1-264x300.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-Cashmere1" width="264" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-646" />&#8220;There&#8217;s only a finite amount in the world. It takes the hair of approximately four goats to make one sweater.&#8221; He explains that a majority of Cashmere goats are raised in China, specifically inner Mongolia in Northwest China. The climate is rough, cold and demanding. The fibers are combed individually to separate the fine fiber from coarse fiber and a lot of care is taken in the procedure. </p>
<p>If you have cashmere on your gift (or wish) list, you&#8217;ll want to avoid low-quality cashmere, which simply is not worth the money, Spilhouse says.</p>
<p>If you see sale prices or promotions on cashmere products, look for these tip-offs that the quality might not be as high as you&#8217;d like:</p>
<p><strong>1. The fabric is very thin.</strong> A 1-ply yarn used in a sweater will yield a very light sweater that may not hold its shape, may release yarns easily and tear and pill as well as not be warm. Turn the sweater inside out and look for 2-ply yarn which means you&#8217;ll see two yarns wound around each other and then knitted. It&#8217;s twice as much material so it will stand up better over time (and be warmer).</p>
<p><strong>2. It&#8217;s not 100 percent cashmere.</strong> According to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/textile/woolact.htm" target="_blank">Wool Products Labeling Act</a> and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, there must be a statement of material percentages in the inner clothing label. Look for the 100 percent cashmere designation because low-priced or promotion-priced cashmere may have an ad or hang tag that says &#8220;cashmere,&#8221; but the inner label may actually read 95 percent cotton and 5 percent cashmere. Some common fabrics blended with cashmere are silk and cotton, both of which are less expensive than pure cashmere. Silk is a “harder” fiber, so silk-and-cashmere-blended garments do not feel quite as soft as 100 percent cashmere. When cashmere is blended with cotton, a lower-priced, cooler garment will provide some of the luxury and softness of cashmere, but not the longevity.</p>
<p><strong>3. It &#8220;pills&#8221; easily.</strong> Gently rub the palm of your hand on the surface of the garment in the store to see if fibers start rolling into little balls, which is called pilling. If it does, cashmere may be made using shorter, lower-quality fibers and will result in unattractive pilling under arms (the hallmark of a cheap sweater).</p>
<p><strong>4. It&#8217;s scratchy and dull.</strong> Good, quality cashmere fibers when knit tightly together create a subtle sheen and a luxurious feel you can only get from a high-quality cashmere product. Look for this sheen and feel whenever purchasing cashmere.</p>
<p><strong>5. The fit is bulky and awkward.</strong> A hallmark of high-quality cashmere is when it conforms naturally to the body. If the sweater is too tight, sticks out in all the wrong places or the wrap does not drape beautifully, then it is not good, quality cashmere.</p>
<p><strong>6.Loses its shape.</strong> Good cashmere is springy. Another quick in-store test is to stretch the garment body side to side and see if it snaps back into shape. If it does not, low-quality fibers or very loose tension when knitted may be the reason. Loosely knit, limp fabric are tip-offs to a cheaply made sweater.</p>
<p><strong>7. A no-name retailer or manufacturer.</strong> Fashion brands and retailers who have a reputation for high-quality apparel and who are known for reliability and integrity in their business, offer the best cashmere at good prices. Always be wary of &#8220;bargains&#8221; with cashmere, especially from unknown brands or retailers.</p>
<h2>How to care for high quality cashmere</h2>
<p>Spilhouse says knit cashmere products are meant to be machine-washable and, over time, get softer and better-fitting when cleaned this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine-wash in cold water on a gentle cycle with gentle detergent.</li>
<li>Never wring or twist. Lay flat on a towel and press another towel over to remove excess moisture.</li>
<li>Dry lying flat.</li>
<li>Woven cashmere products, such as a jacket, need to be dry-cleaned. Always check the care label.</li>
<li>Never hang knit cashmere products by hanger. Instead, store flat. When not in use, fold flat and protect from moths in a sealed garment bag.</li>
<li>Never leave cashmere dirty because that will attract moths.</li>
</ul>

While the legend of Christmas includes Santa placing presents under a dazzling tree, those that believe are also known to receive pocket-sized pleasures in their stockings. Some view stocking stuffing as a light appetizer, but most have no problem filling theirs to capacity. </p>
<p>What is the proper protocol when it comes to budgeting? “It really irks me when I see $50 or $100 items advertised as ‘stocking stuffers.’ Perhaps put one or two higher priced items in, but that’s it. Even then I would say $25 should be the limit,” advises Liz Mills, owner of <a href="http://thestockingstufferstore.com" target="_blank">TheStockingStufferStore.com</a>. </p>
<p>The holiday trinket connoisseur says that the key to purchasing stellar stuffers lies in bending the rules. “Essentials are great, but it’s also nice to have a few items where the recipient goes ‘cool’ because they haven’t seen it before,” she says. Step away from the drugstore and hunt for specialty boutiques or online hubs that specialize in the odd and unusual. Mills adds, “…that’s what makes a stocking so much fun, as I can go buy my own toothpaste and shampoo … . My husband is a sport motorcycle rider and enthusiast, and I found a magazine imported from the UK where that sport is huge. It’s more expensive than standard magazines, but it’s very niche — so well worth it. Specialty magazines make a great stocking stuffer because there are magazines on virtually everything and most people have a passion for something.” </p>
<p>If your loved one’s passion includes bubbly, allow him or her to sip fearlessly by gifting them with the all popular <a href="https://www.thestockingstufferstore.ca/shopping//shopexd.asp?id=320" target="_blank">Wine Wipes</a> ($8.99). It advertises that it will remove red wine stains from your teeth without interfering with the taste of your wine. </p>
<p>The adult fun doesn’t stop there. Another best-seller for Mills is the Pop-Up Wine Glass ($12.99). The verbiage describing the portable stemware explains, “… no more drinking wine from cheap paper cups, the Pop Up Wine Glass means you can always drink in style.” The company is based out of England, so it might be easiest to purchase this item off of <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to catering to the gift recipient’s passions, identifying a theme helps consumers remain focused on a budget. Mills reveals that this year, shoppers are gravitating toward <a href="https://www.thestockingstufferstore.ca/shopping//shopexd.asp?id=290" target="_blank">TV trivia</a> from the 1970s, 80s and 90s ($9.99). Another popular gift this year is moustaches. The store’s <a href="https://www.thestockingstufferstore.ca/shopping//shopexd.asp?id=267" target="_blank">Emergency Mustache Kit</a> ($8.99) “contains 6 moustaches to instantly ‘become a man!’ Traditional Gent, Cowboy, Rusty Brush, Italian Plumber, Oil Baron and Abra-Kadabra!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another theme that often follows the season of indulgence is health and wellness. <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePontesGroup" target="_blank">Lais Pontes</a>, of <a href="http://www.thepontesgroup.com" target="_blank">The Pontes Group</a>, says that her stocking stuffer of choice helps friends get over the post-holiday slump. If you’re pumping up for a work out, <a href="http://www.energems.net" target="_blank">Energems</a> ($2.99 per box) is a dietary supplement that resembles an M&#038;M. Energems is promoting its product as the first energy drink to be made with real milk chocolate: &#8220;They are portable, let you control how much or little energy you need, taste decadent, cost $2.99 and are only 15 calories each!” </p>
<p>Those who prefer to bundle up, as opposed to working out, can stay classic without breaking the bank. Scoop up this <a href="http://www.closetdeep.com/index.php/catalogsearch/result/?q=scarf" target="_blank">trio of exquisite scarves</a> from <a href="http://www.closetdeep.com/" target="_blank">Closet Deep</a> for the three little bears in your life. “It is an online destination created by sisters Kristine and Stephanie Navas. The site features an eclectic mix of both classic and edgy styles,” with clothes, accessories and home goods starting at just $6.99, Pontes says. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-CostOfHolidayFeast.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-CostOfHolidayFeast" width="600" height="367" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-690" />With all the presents to buy during the holiday season, it easy to forget about how costly meals and cocktail parties can be. Entertaining expenses can pile up faster than guests’ coats in a back bedroom.</p>
<p>To keep your feasts and fetes budget-friendly, <a href="https://twitter.com/DiansDeals" target="_blank">Dian Farmer</a>, a grocery-shopping expert for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/favado/id703787093" target="_blank">Favado</a>, a new, free app that can help you slash grocery costs, offers these tips for saving at the supermarket, especially during the holidays when you’ve only got so much in your wallet, but a lot on your plate.</p>
<p><strong>1. Focus on the front page of the supermarket circular.</strong><br />
The front page features items with the deepest discounts that are only on sale for that week. These deals are designed to get you in the door, so pay attention. Don’t worry so much about flipping through the circular. “Some of the items in the middle, if you look closely, may be normal price,” Farmer says.</p>
<p><strong>2. Wait for the right sale. </strong><br />
When something goes on sale, stock up on it. That’s common food-shopping advice. But Farmer has another take. “The best way to stock up is to know your rock-bottom sale price for items, wait for that sale, then use coupons on sale items and buy as much as you need of that item until the next sale,” Farmer says. Sales run in cycles. Many products go on sale every six to 12 weeks. PushPenny.com <a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/2013/11/18/purchase-cooking-baking-staples-now/" target="_blank">recently reported</a> that retailers start advertising sales and deals during the holiday season for baking goods, so now is a good time to stock up on those items. </p>
<p><strong>3. Keep a price book. </strong><br />
<object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/52BbMO2CfoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/52BbMO2CfoE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br />
To spot a great sale versus a so-so one, and predict when the next great sale will be, keep a price book with a list of best prices for your favorite products, such as peanut butter, chicken, milk, bread and cereal. “Take a notebook with you when you’re shopping and jot down the prices of the items you like to buy each time you go to the store,” Farmer says. Within a span of 12 weeks, you’ll see that there will be a rock-bottom price for the products you’re tracking. “A price book is work in the beginning, but it pays off,” Farmer says. From her price book, Farmer created a price-tracking spreadsheet. Using this method, she spends less than $200 per month on groceries, for herself, her husband and one teenage son. Her goal is to never pay more than the rock-bottom price for an item.</p>
<p>“Wait for the rock-bottom price and keep your coupons until then,” Farmer says. Sometimes that can mean holding your coupons until just before they expire, to time them with the rock-bottom-price sale. Then, stock up. “Be picky. Try not to use coupons during so-so sales,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In lieu of or in conjunction with a price book, an app such as Favado can help you track coupons and sale items at stores in your area. All you have to do is select items you buy regularly from the app’s grocery list and the app will notify will notify you when they’re on sale.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cash in at Wal-Mart. </strong><br />
Spending less than $200 per month on groceries is quite a feat. But Farmer has done even better than that. “I’ve saved over 100 percent on my grocery shopping trips,” she says. In other words, Farmer has actually pocketed money on some grocery expeditions. How? By shopping at Wal-Mart, which gives shoppers money back if the coupons they use exceed the price of a product.</p>
<p>Let’s say Wal-Mart has Tropicana orange juice on sale for $1.88, and you have a coupon for $2 off any Tropicana product. Unlike most supermarkets, Wal-Mart will give you the $.12 you’re due instead of just honoring the coupon to the price of the product, in this case $1.88).</p>
<p>There’s more. Wal-Mart doesn’t double or triple coupons, but it does have a generous ad-matching policy. If an item is on sale at your local supermarket for less than what it’s selling for at Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart will give you the local supermarket’s sale price. “You don’t even have to carry your supermarket circular with you to prove it,” Farmer says. In her neck of the woods, for example, local Hispanic markets will often sell 15 oranges for $1.<br />
“At the register at Wal-Mart, I just tell the cashier before she scans my oranges that I can get 15 oranges for $1 and she gives me that price,” Farmer says. However, all Wal-Marts might not operate the same way, so it is better to be safe than sorry. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120613-PushPenny-CraftKindness.jpg" alt="120613-PushPenny-CraftKindness" width="600" height="367" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-678" />This time of year, with all the TV ads your kids are probably seeing for toys and electronics, it’s easy to get a big case of the gimmes. But with all the focus on stuff and gift lists, it’s also easy to turn the conversation around, from “What do you want for Christmas?” to “How can we help others who are less fortunate?”</p>
<p>“The holidays offers a great opportunity to help children practice kindness and start developing the skills and abilities that help them show compassion for others,” says Rachel Robertson, the director of educational development at <a href="http://www.brighthorizons.com/" target="_blank">Bright Horizons Children’s Centers</a>, which is headquartered in Watertown, Mass. Philanthropy may seem like a complex concept for some kids, but even preschoolers can grasp the idea because children are naturally empathetic. “Even as infants, they’ll cry sympathetically when they hear another baby who is upset,” Robertson says.</p>
<p>Teaching children to give back now can set the tone for their charitable future. Adult giving and volunteering are part of an ongoing pattern of behavior that starts early in life, according to the study Women Give 2013 by the United Nations Foundation and researchers at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University in Indianapolis. The study, which followed the same 903 children over two time periods, 2002-2003 and 2007-2008, asked them each time whether they ever gave some of their money — if only a few pennies — to a church, synagogue or charity. It also asked the child’s primary caregiver, usually the child’s mom, whether he or she ever talked to the child about giving money to charity. The study found caregivers who talked to the children about giving significantly increased the likelihood the child would give to charity later, whether the parents actually did so themselves. The findings were consistent across all income levels and genders.</p>
<p>Having your child donate a portion of his or her allowance to a cause of his or her choice is one way kids can give back. But there other creative and unique ways you can teach your child how to help others with little or any cost. Here’s a sampling of family-friendly service project ideas fitting for this time of year — and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Send homemade get-well cards.</strong> With blank cards and envelopes and whatever decorating supplies you have on hand, such as markers, crayons, stamp pads and stickers, have your kids create personalized greeting cards and send &#8220;happy mail&#8221; to a child diagnosed with a life-threatening illness or suffering from serious injury through organizations such as <a href="http://www.sendkidstheworld.com" target="_blank">Send Kids the World</a> or <a href="http://www.hugsandhope.org" target="_blank">Hugs and Hope</a>. Be sure to include an uplifting message, such as “Thinking about you!” While your kids are busy decorating, talk to them about the meaning of the activity. Ask questions, such as: &#8220;Would you like to receive mail if you were sick?&#8221; &#8220;How would it make you feel?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer in your community.</strong> “Find organizations in your area that work with people who don’t have a place to go for the holidays,” Robertson suggests. At her local Armed Services YMCA, for example, Robertson and her family of four girls ages 10 to 19, can sign up to sponsor a U.S. Marine to come over for Christmas dinner. Other organizations to approach include a local assisted living facility or <a href="http://www.mowaa.org" target="_blank">Meals on Wheels</a>. There’s nothing like a child to brighten the day of someone who can’t get out of the house or who doesn’t have much contact with the outside world. “Call these facilities and ask them what you and your kids might do for them,” says Robertson, who is also the co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Children-Lives-Wellness-Childhood/dp/1605540811" target="_blank">Healthy Children, Healthy Lives</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor a micro loan.</strong> Through crowd-funding organizations, such as <a href="http://www.kiva.org/start" target="_blank">Kiva</a>, which provide loans to small, family-owned businesses in developing countries that don’t have access to traditional banking systems, your child can lend as little as $25 to entrepreneurs in need of cash. The donation could allow a farmer add a cow to his small herd or help a home cook start a food-delivery business. Kiva helps drive home the concept that we’re all in this together. If 100 people contribute $25 to one person’s goal, that person in need can make some headway; 99.9 percent of Kiva loans are repaid on time. Have your kids read through the bios and decide for themselves which idea appeals to them. When the loan is repaid, they can choose to loan the money to someone else.</p>
<p>These are just a few ways you can help your child get in the spirit of giving. You can also use the dinner table to drive home the concept daily. In addition to the basic round of questions, such as: “How was your day?” add: “How did you make someone’s day today?” Robertson says.</p>

<p>
Two years ago, then 19-year-old <a href="https://twitter.com/Jlekstro" target="_blank">Jessica Ekstrom</a> was inspired by her work at the <a href="http://wish.org" target="_blank">Make-a-Wish Foundation</a> to make a difference.<br />
<a href="http://www.headbandsofhope.org/pages/founder-and-history"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Headbands-of-Hope2-300x295.jpg" alt="Headbands of Hope2" width="150" height="145" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-654" /></a></p>
<p>“I was pulling my hair back in a ponytail and thought about the hundreds of girls I encountered that lose their hair to cancer. Being a young girl presents many struggles with self-esteem already, and losing their hair as a result of a life-threatening illness is traumatic,” she says.</p>
<p>She took action by creating <a href="http://www.headbandsofhope.org/collections/all" target="_blank">Headbands of Hope</a>. “For every headband purchased, one is given to a girl with cancer. $1 is donated to the <a href="http://www.stbaldricks.org/" target="_blank">St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation</a> to fund life-saving childhood cancer research.” From shimmery beaded pieces to knockout headwraps, each band retails for less than $20. “Over 10,000 headbands have been donated to girls across the country and that same amount has been donated to St. Baldrick&#8217;s,” she adds. </p>
<h2><a href="http://www.denik.com" target="_blank">Denik</a></h2>
<p>Denik also helps children in need. It teams up with fine artists across the globe to design journals and sketchbooks that fund school construction.</p>
<p>“Currently the artwork is submitted through our website and reviewed by our art team. … We&#8217;re building a middle school in Mali, Africa. Mali is in desperate need of schools and increased education,” says CEO and founder of Denik <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertolson" target="_blank">Tyler Tolson</a>. </p>
<p>Popping with color and bold themes, the journals are $12. $1 from each purchase is donated to building schools and 5 percent is paid to the designer. “As the user shares their own story on the pages of the notebook, they become part of something bigger. It stores memories, ideas, and passions,” he shares.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.beyondbuckskin.com/p/buy-native.html" target="_blank">Buy Native</a></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_632" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://beyondbuckskinboutique.bigcartel.com/product/moundville-ring"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BuyNative2.jpg" alt="Kristen Dorsey Designs" width="150" height="119" class="size-full wp-image-632" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kristen Dorsey Designs</p></div>Like Denik, the <a href="http://www.beyondbuckskin.com/2013/11/buy-native-2013.html" target="_blank">Buy Native Campaign</a> launched in 2011, during the recession. </p>
<p>“I was thinking about ways that we, regular people, can help our current economic situation, says <a href="https://twitter.com/beyondbuckskin" target="_blank">Jessica Metcalfe</a>, who organized a consortium of Native American jewelers, crafters, home decor and clothing designers. <div id="attachment_631" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 185px"><a href="http://beyondbuckskinboutique.bigcartel.com/artist/kristen-dorsey-chickasaw?page=1"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BuyNative1-281x300.jpg" alt="Kristen Dorsey Designs" width="175" height="194" class="size-medium wp-image-631" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kristen Dorsey Designs</p></div>&#8220;Individuals spend hundreds of dollars on gifts each holiday season, and if we put even a fraction of that money back into our local economies then we have the potential to see immediate positive impacts … our Native American artists, designers, and businesspeople are some of the most vastly underrepresented in the retail industry.”</p>
<p>Chickasaw jeweler <a href="http://www.kristendorseydesigns.com" target="_blank">Kristen Dorsey</a> adds, “Native-owned businesses are a way for this unique knowledge and artistic traditions to be passed onto the next generation. The culture is preserved and allows for (small) business owners to make a viable living doing what they are passionate about.&#8221; Her designs are featured on the <a href="http://beyondbuckskinboutique.bigcartel.com/artist/kristen-dorsey-chickasaw" target="_blank">Beyond Buckskin</a> website. </p>
<h2><a href="http://www.changingthepresent.org" target="_blank">Changing the Present</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.oxfamamericaunwrapped.com" target="_blank">Oxfam America</a></h2>
<p>If you’re anti-gift wrapping, you can still be pro-cause by linking with hubs such as Oxfam America and Changing the Present. Both sites allow users to select gifts that directly impact change within a chosen region or field of interest. </p>
<p>Starting at $5 on <a href="http://www.changingthepresent.org" target="_blank">ChangingThePresent.org</a>, you can select from thousands of charities and non-profits to “… preserve an acre of the rain forest, fund an hour of cancer research, or provide shoes for girls in Africa so they can attend school,” says representative <a href="https://twitter.com/rtolmach" target="_blank">Robert Tolmach</a>. </p>
<p>

<p>
Oxfam America’s mission is to create long-lasting solutions to end global poverty, hunger and injustice. Its &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; list of charitable gifts includes a goat (&#8216;<a href="https://www.oxfamamericaunwrapped.com/gifts/donate-goat/" target="_blank">The Kid</a>&#8216;) and building tools (&#8216;<a href="https://www.oxfamamericaunwrapped.com/gifts/donate-tools/" target="_blank">The Fixer</a>&#8216;),” all of which promote self-sustainability. Gifts start at $12.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/Y8nX_mKnQg0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/Y8nX_mKnQg0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>&#8220;Consumers today do not believe the price they see is the best price they can get,&#8221; says James Dion, president of retail consultant <a href="http://www.dionco.com" target="_blank">DionCo</a>. We go into stores to see and feel products, try them out or try them on, speak to sales associates for information and then we go online, sometimes while still standing in the store, to buy the product at a cheaper price. Retailers call it showrooming – treating stores like showrooms. Consumers call it &#8220;getting the best possible price.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the 2013 Holiday Retail Spending Survey from <a href="http://cfigroup.com" target="_blank">CFI Group</a>, a retail analytics company, shoppers who plan to spend more than half their holiday gift budgets online, three quarters are confirmed “showroomers.” The survey found that men are the biggest showroomers of all. Nearly one-third of men say they showroom all or most of the time and 60 percent of men said they showroom electronics. Only 22 percent of women indicate they showroom all or most of the time.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for showrooming is the amount of money consumers can save. More than two-thirds of respondents said they expect to save between 25 percent and 50 percent going to the store first and then purchasing online. That&#8217;s a big chunk of change.</p>
<h2>How retailers curb consumer showrooming</h2>
<p>Retailers have tried to fight it. Earlier this year <a href="http://www.verawang.com" target="_blank">Vera Wang</a>&#8216;s bridal boutique in Shanghai was charging customers nearly $500 for a fitting fee (since repealed due to consumer outcry in the media). A health-food store in Brisbane, Australia, charges a $5 &#8220;just-looking&#8221; fee. Both fees were deducted from actual purchases.</p>
<p>Michael Paulsen, former vice president of <a href="http://Decide.com" target="_blank">Decide.com</a>, a price-tracking tool recently purchased by eBay, says retailers purposely create store brands, product bundles, specific products, model numbers and SKU numbers and QR codes that are exclusive to the store so the codes cannot be scanned or price-checked. Consider Insignia and Dynex &#8220;house&#8221; brand electronics only sold at Best Buy. INC brand apparel is only available at <a href="http://www.macys.com" target="_blank">Macy&#8217;s</a>. Exclusive item bundles and gifts sets where products are not sold separately such as brand name fragrance gift sets containing odd product sizes or food and kitchen utensil item gift sets at <a href="http://www.rossstores.com" target="_blank">Ross</a> or <a href="http://tjmaxx.tjx.com" target="_blank">T.J. Maxx</a> or even a barbecue grill and utensil set or toy set created specifically for <a href="http://www.costco.com" target="_blank">Costco</a>. None of these can be price-checked.</p>
<h2>Showroom to your advantage</h2>
<p>Stores have recently found that trying to stop consumers from showrooming only hurts sales and are now embracing the practice. <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> is hoping to attract users with &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bestbuy?feature=watch" target="_blank">Your Ultimate Holiday Showroom</a>&#8221; holiday advertising campaign showcasing its online and in-store experiences. Store associates from <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com" target="_blank">Nordstrom</a> to <a href="http://www.coach.com" target="_blank">Coach</a> and even <a href="http://www.jcpenney.com" target="_blank">JC Penney</a> will be carrying iPads to help you find information, availability and even price-check their products. And most retailers will match the advertised price of a competitor.</p>
<p>A remarkable example of this happened at Nordstrom in November. <a href="http://www.bloomingdales.com" target="_blank">Bloomingdale&#8217;s</a> ran a 20 percent off Friends and Family sale. Nordstrom&#8217;s, not wanting to be out-showroomed by smartphone price-checking customers, matched prices on the same SKU numbers from the Bloomingdale&#8217;s sale and further advertised the discounts online and with in-store signage and special price tags.</p>
<p>At the urging of retail consultants, stores such as <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com" target="_blank">Bed, Bath &#038; Beyond</a> regularly price-check branded items against <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.target.com" target="_blank">Target</a> and other nearby competitors to price items within a few dollars or even lower so customers won&#8217;t have a reason to leave the store and order online. The moral of the story: Just ask those iPad-wielding sales associates if they will price match for you, or give you a coupon or code to purchase the item in the store.</p>
<h2>Focus on features</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t just rely on Amazon for the best prices, which isn&#8217;t always the cheapest depending on the day and product category. Instead, first try scanning the UPC bar code using a smartphone price-checking app such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redlaser-barcode-scanner-shopping/id474902001" target="_blank">RedLaser</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pricegrabber/id341253803" target="_blank">PriceGrabber</a>. If that fails a match, try searching within the app search bar and also in a general internet search engine for the exact model name and number. Another consideration is the desired features in anything you are shopping for, says <a href="http://www.andreaworoch.com" target="_blank">Andrea Woroch</a>, consumer savings expert for <a href="http://www.kinoliinc.com" target="_blank">Kinoli Inc</a>. Whether it is specific items in a bedding set or specific controls on an HDTV, you can search for similar products with the same features when faced with products that cannot be exactly matched and price-checked. Paulsen also suggests bringing along a list of other brands you would consider.</p>
<p>Just be careful when searching for cheaper prices online. &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t heard of the retailer, check for negative reviews and beware of counterfeitters for branded products such as UGG footwear, Coach handbags, Michael Kors watches and other designer brands, because scammers are out in droves during the holidays,&#8221; Woroch warns.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/112913-PushPenny-GoogleTrack.jpg" alt="112913-PushPenny-GoogleTrack" width="600" height="384" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-596" />In case you hadn&#8217;t noticed, Google has gotten a lot more personal on your smartphone this year. Not only does it barrage you with products you searched for and didn&#8217;t buy, but it also tells you about the weather and your transit time to someplace you recently searched, even if you aren&#8217;t headed there. Some people think this is an under-handed use of the search function on Google&#8217;s part and would rather it not track our every search and move.</p>
<p>But now, in a slightly more helpful twist, Google can search your email, calendar and transactions to keep track of your online purchases, plans, travels, holiday parties, events and dates. It can find what you ordered, when it shipped and when it will be delivered. It can tell you whether you will hit traffic in transit, find your flights and reservations and if your flight will arrive on time. You have this information at the tip of your fingers without having to dig or search for the information, which might go a long way to smoothing your holiday shopping and travels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Google already has access to this information, I see no new privacy concerns,&#8221; says <a href="https://twitter.com/airfarewatchdog" target="_blank">George Hobica</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.AirfareWatchdog.com" target="_blank">AirfareWatchdog.com</a>. &#8220;It’s just a more convenient way of accessing information without having to type on those tiny smartphone keyboards.</p>
<p>You can also use these same techniques on your home computer or any mobile device, all without having to dig around for the information, which just might go a long way to smoothing your holiday shopping and travels.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s very personal</h2>
<p>What you need to remember about this &#8220;personal&#8221; Google Search service is that it is actually searching your personal, private Google profile for the information: Gmail, Google Calendar and your Google+ account. If you don&#8217;t have order confirmations and travel plans confirmed via Gmail or you don&#8217;t use Google Calendar for your daily plans, Google won&#8217;t be able to find them for you. </p>
<p>If you want to be able to use Google to answer personal questions about your plans, purchases and daily life made offline, then send yourself a Gmail with the appropriate subject line or put it in your Google Calendar so Google can find it for you very quickly and easily. For example, if you went to the post office to mail a package and want to keep the tracking number handy, put it in your Google Calendar and it will become a searchable item you can retrieve with a click of the search button. Additionally, Google can help you find your personal photos, but only if they are uploaded to Google+ and tagged correctly. If your photos are saved to Dropbox or Facebook, Google won&#8217;t be able to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t remember when you ordered that Furby for your niece? Don&#8217;t know off-hand what time you arrive in New York? If you want Google to find your personal information for you, just type or speak your request by tapping the Google search bar on your phone, and more often then not, Google will politely speak the response. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<h2>Today&#8217;s schedule</h2>
<p>Ask Google “What are my plans for tomorrow?” to see and hear a summary of upcoming flights, hotels, restaurant reservations and events. This can be a very useful tool when you’re traveling. Also, you can ask for &#8220;My calendar today&#8221; to hear what you need to do or prepare for next as well as to see the rest of the day&#8217;s plans without having to open your whole calendar and every event separately. </p>
<h2>Your purchases</h2>
<p>Ask Google for “My purchases” and you’ll get the status of your current orders. It will list what you bought, when your items shipped and the delivery time. It will list all your purchases, which is especially helpful if you want to keep track of everything you ordered online for everyone on your holiday list.</p>
<h2>Upcoming flights</h2>
<p>You can tell Google &#8220;Show my flights,&#8221; or you can ask specifics such as, &#8220;Is my flight on time?&#8221; or, &#8220;What is my flight number?&#8221; or, &#8220;What time do I arrive in New York?&#8221; Google can&#8217;t, however, give you information about past flights.</p>
<h2>Ask about hotel or dining reservations</h2>
<p>Just ask Google to show, &#8220;My reservation&#8221; or, &#8220;My hotel&#8221; to see dates and times. If you need driving directions you can tap once more on the link to directions that appears next to each place on your list.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you want Google to butt out of your life entirely, don&#8217;t use any of Google&#8217;s services, app or products.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/120213-PushPenny-Benjamins.jpg" alt="120213-PushPenny-Benjamins" width="600" height="377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-574" />With the season of consumerism upon us, it&#8217;s the opportune time to teach your teens about money. </p>
<p>Maryland-based investment firm, <a href="http://corporate.troweprice.com/ccw/home.do" target="_blank">T. Rowe Price</a>, believes in starting conversations early. </p>
<p>“Although parents don’t have to reveal everything, openly discussing family finances will make it more likely that kids will learn and share financial lessons – and help them understand that the topic of money is not taboo. Kids are already drawing conclusions – right or wrong – from what they observe. As a parent, you have the opportunity to help them put that all in context, to help them develop the skills of managing through difficult times,” says <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stuart-ritter/0/ab5/178" target="_blank">Stuart Ritter</a>, a senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price. </p>
<p>It is important to start teaching them early, <em>before</em> your children start making poor financial decision. “As soon as your kids begin to notice that buying things is part of life,” Ritter explains. “They will catch on very quickly that paper bills and metal coins can be exchanged for things.” </p>
<p>Building their financial vocabulary is the first step to help youngsters understand transactions. </p>
<p>“When you are pushing them in the cart at the grocery store, tell them how much the bananas (cost) … . Explain to them that you have a $1 coupon off of two containers of the favorite oatmeal,” says <a href="http://www.GrammarGumbo.com" target="_blank">Sorina Fant</a>, a mother, former elementary school teacher and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hailey-Fantrugal-CCO-Couponing-Officer/dp/0615795773/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1369234060&#038;sr=1-5 " target="_blank">“Hailey Fantrugal, Chief Couponing Officer.”</a> </p>
<p>Fant’s book was inspired by her upbringing. “My mother was the person that couponed in the family, but around the third grade my math grades began to decline. My mom passed the coupon torch to me. I was able to apply the concepts that I was having trouble with in class (fractions, percentages) to our weekly shopping trips. I hunted for the deals with the best value for my family,” she remembers. Her parents rewarded their &#8220;Chief Couponing Officer&#8221; with a percentage of the household cash she saved. </p>
<p>Another teaching moment is transforming budgeting tasks, such as couponing and comparison shopping, into positive experiences. As teens they’ll process details better. &#8220;… Parents need to explain the importance of setting long-term goals like saving for a car, college or even retirement,” Ritter urges. By the age of 15, teens should be ready to invest, he says. They should also understand the concept of inflation, credit, interest and balancing a checkbook. </p>
<p>“Begin a concrete 50-40-10 system,” advises Fant. If you save 50 percent, spend 40 percent and give 10 percent away, it teaches balance, moderation and security. Before your teens become adults, “encourage them to save at least 50 percent of their earnings in a college/’rainy day’ savings account. </p>
<p>When spending their 40 percent, parents should step back. “Give them restrictions that compliment how you are raising them, but do not tell them what they can or cannot buy. They need to have confidence in themselves to make sound decisions. If you don’t want them spending their money on a ton of candy, tell them that. But do not tell them that they cannot buy a racecar magazine because you want them to purchase a different type of magazine.” </p>
<p>Giving 10 percent to charitable organizations reinforces that “…philanthropy is a learned behavior,” she stresses. “They need to understand that the flow of money is circular. Put money out there, to help someone else, and positive things will come back to you.”</p>
<p>Being a financial role model during tight times isn’t about being perfect. Honesty prepares your mini me for the future. “Thousands of teens are … maintaining blogs with high traffic and selling items that they are making from their bedrooms. The future belongs to the person with the entrepreneurial mind,” Fant adds. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/112913-PushPenny-BabyBump.jpg" alt="112913-PushPenny-BabyBump" width="600" height="214" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603" />From singer <a href="https://twitter.com/gwenstefani" target="_blank">Gwen Stefani</a> to actresses <a href="https://twitter.com/DrewBarrymore" target="_blank">Drew Barrymore</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kerrywashington" target="_blank">Kerry Washington</a>, &#8216;baby bumps&#8217; are the newest accessory in Hollywood. </p>
<p>Just because you haven’t been knighted with a personal stylist doesn’t mean that you have to go bargain bin hunting when your belly expands. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/avoro19" target="_blank">Abby Vorobeychik</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.9Bliss.com" target="_blank">9Bliss.com</a>, which offers a daily guide ‘to nine months of bliss,’ there are two major complaints of budget conscious mommy’s to be. “1. I feel guilty buying nice things that I&#8217;ll never wear again and 2. Maternity clothes never fit me right,&#8221; she says. To tackle those dilemmas, women should invest in multifunctional brands, such as <a href="http://www.keungzai.com" target="_blank">Keungzai</a> or <a href="http://hatchcollection.com" target="_blank">Hatch</a>, which can be worn during and after pregnancy. Vorobeychik also suggests hunting “for dresses and shirts with ruching, which will allow the clothes to grow and shrink with you.” </p>
<p><a href="http://s368.photobucket.com/user/theybf/media/October%202013/KerryWashingtonKerryWashingtonStopsDailyjq7iqhX2m5fl_zps5d2f310d.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo126/theybf/October%202013/KerryWashingtonKerryWashingtonStopsDailyjq7iqhX2m5fl_zps5d2f310d.jpg" alt=" photo KerryWashingtonKerryWashingtonStopsDailyjq7iqhX2m5fl_zps5d2f310d.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-201" /></a></p>
<p>Maternity trends often mirror contemporary fashion, which translates into more bang for your buck. Hold tight to closet staples like blazers. “Try wearing an open blazer or coat from your pre-pregnancy days. It will instantly dress-up an inexpensive, casual maternity piece underneath it,” says the former Conde Nast corporate director. You can also stretch the love by stepping into the <a href="http://www.ingridandisabel.com/product/1111/bellaband-everyday.html" target="_blank">Ingrid &#038; Isabel BellaBand</a> ($19.99). It “lets you wear non-maternity pants as your belly grows, allowing you to get more use out of what&#8217;s already in your closet.”</p>
<p>After accessing your carry over items, elevate your look to superstar status, with daring add-ons. Leather and lace embellishments will transform you from frump to electric. “There&#8217;s something about putting on lace that makes you instantly feel pretty. It&#8217;s a great style to wear to the seasons&#8217; parties, and it dresses up your work wear,” she explains. One of her favorites this season is a <a href="http://www.apeainthepod.com/Product.asp?Product_Id=275110559&#038;MasterCategory_Id=MC47&#038;kpid=P-27511%20&#038;mr:trackingCode=C4CB115F-B50C-E311-B773-BC305BF933C0&#038;mr:referralID=NA&#038;mr:adType=pla&#038;mr:ad=27826370186&#038;mr:keyword=&#038;mr:match=&#038;mr:filter=41985029666&#038;utm_source=google&#038;utm_medium=cpc&#038;utm_term=&#038;utm_content=PLA%20-%20Tees%20%26%20Tanks&#038;utm_campaign=Product%20Listing%20Ads%20-%20Search&#038;gclid=CMqG8tGUhLsCFWQOOgodOzoAig" target="_blank">long sleeve scoop neck lace back shirt</a> from BCBG.</p>
<p>Guilt will dissipate when splurging on multifunctional looks that have a sense of purpose. </p>
<p>“A lot of women will splurge on one or two things they need for specific occasions and then have little left to stock their every day wardrobe, resulting in a love-fest with their sweats,” Vorobeychik says. If your figure has done a 180 and you’re left with few carry over items, stay calm. After stocking up on basics, such as comfortable underwear and tanks, splurge on 2 key items — jeans and comfortable shoes. </p>
<p>“Your feet will grow during pregnancy, so having a pair of shoes that fit well may be the key to true happiness. If they look great, too, you&#8217;ll instantly feel put together when you throw them on.&#8221; With a great pair of jeans &#8220;… you&#8217;ll wear them so much that your CPW (cost per wear) will be close to $0!” she adds. </p>
<p>While celebrities have go-to designers, some of them have created lines that mirror their personal styles for less. Jessica Simpson celebrated her body during her latest pregnancy with maxi dresses — a great everyday look that can be paired with leggings in the winter. Purchase similar designs from her <a href="http://www.destinationmaternity.com/Product.asp?Product_Id=97643Z20571&#038;MasterCategory_Id=MC28" target="_blank">Destination Maternity collection</a>, starting at $59. </p>
<p>Kerry Washington favors tailored A-line dresses that gently conceal her bump.<br />
Duplicate the same construction for $29.99 by shopping <a href="http://www.target.com/p/liz-lange-for-target-maternity-sleeveless-ponte-dress-black/-/A-14645716#prodSlot=large_1_7" target="_blank">Liz Lange for Target</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1202-PushPenny-NutriSavings.jpg" alt="1202-PushPenny-NutriSavings" width="600" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-587" />Would you eat healthier if you were paid?</p>
<p>Your employer may soon be banking on it by offering <a href="http://www.nutrisavings.com" target="_blank">NutriSavings</a>, an employee benefit program dedicated to promoting healthy eating and employee wellness. </p>
<p>“NutriSavings incentivizes employees with money and education to eat healthier,” says Jacques Stern, the CEO of <a href="http://www.edenredusa.com" target="_blank">Edenred</a>, a world leader in employee benefits based in Malakoff, France, that developed the NutriSavings program. </p>
<p>Administered through a company’s human resources department, NutriSavings is a portal program that promotes eating a healthier diet by giving employees cash back every time they buy healthy food at one of the 25,000 participating retailers in the U.S., including farmer’s markets. NutriSavings scores items from 1 to 100, with one being the worst and 100 the best. </p>
<p>The scoring system’s algorithm, which was developed by nutritionists and registered dietitians, combines data from the nutrition facts panel and ingredients lists on food packages, dietary reference intakes, which are defined by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, and guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture. Every item purchased is tracked and scored when you scan the product’s bar code or the item is scanned at a register. When you’re done shopping, you can consult your score online or by using NutriSavings&#8217; smartphone app, which is customized per company. You’ll also receive detailed information about the nutritional quality of your purchases. </p>
<p>Employers that offer NutriSavings, which is a free benefit to employees,  can decide how much money its employees get back per healthy item purchased. The value is estimated to be 20 percent cash back or up to $15 per month, for a total savings of $400 per year per participating employee. For further savings, NutriSavings participants will also be encouraged to save money through coupons and price reductions on high-scoring NutriSavings items offered at the point of sale. </p>
<p>NutriSavings launched in the U.S. in October when Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare in Boston became one of its first customers. The health plan will begin offering NutriSavings as a benefit to its 1.7 million employees beginning in January. </p>
<p>Jeremy Nobel, adjunct lecturer in the department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health, will be conducting a research study with Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare to determine if NutriSavings can change the eating behavior of its employees. He says consumers can still overeat, so it isn&#8217;t a given that if consumers buy healthier food, they will be healthier.</p>
<p>Today, obesity is a bigger risk factor for chronic disease than smoking. “We overeat and we eat the wrong things,” Nobel says. Excess body fat burdens the cardiovascular system and can lead to everything from back pain to heart disease. Yet Nobel is hopeful. </p>
<p>“NutriSavings goes to the heart of how you change behavior. As a consumer, you have to have a sense of awareness, a vision of being healthier, and information at the point of decision making,” he says. </p>
<p>In 3 to 5 years, Jacques Stern estimates that 5 million U.S. workers will participate in NutriSavings. Companies invest in the program, which has an estimated cost to companies of $850 per employee per month, in hopes that it will save money in the long run. “It’s a big investment,” Stern says. The overall goal of NutriSavings is to reduce chronic disease and health care costs. When employees are healthier and reduce their health care costs, companies reduce their health care costs by paying less for health insurance. NutriSavings may help companies manage their payroll costs through reduced absenteeism too.</p>
<p>Research shows that the idea of paying employees to change behavior could be good for business. A study in Preventing Chronic Disease involving 1,282 transit workers in Austin, Texas, for example, found that health care costs diminished and worker absenteeism decreased by 25 percent after the company, Capital Metro, began offering cash incentives to employees who joined weight-loss programs, used the on-site gym, lost weight, purchased healthy food in the cafeteria or met other criteria for participating in its employee wellness program. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/112213-PushPenny-ShoppingApps.jpg" alt="Print" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569" />If you&#8217;ve been using free shopping apps on your smartphone to help you save money while shopping, then you already know they can help you price check items and search and receive additional coupons and discounts that can be deducted at the register.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t been using smartphone apps then you have been paying retailers more than you have to,&#8221; says shopping expert <a href="http://www.andreaworoch.com" target="_blank">Andrea Woroch</a>. She says many existing shopping apps have upgraded their services to save you even more money than before.</p>
<p>Stephanie Nelson, founder of <a href="http://www.couponmom.com" target="_blank">CouponMom.com</a>, says she looks for new apps that allow you to pile even more savings on top of coupons and sales you have already used in store.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the list of this year&#8217;s must-have mobile shopping apps:</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibotta-cash-not-coupons/id559887125?mt=8" target="_blank">Ibotta</a>: Gives cash back</h2>
<p>You can earn cash by using this new iPhone and Android app, even if you are using a manufacturer coupon, a store coupon and the item is on sale. The app will ask you to read a quick fact and then answer a question about how you shop and/or watch a video about a product. Once you buy the product, scan the receipt and the product bar codes to earn cash. When you reach $5, money can be directed into your Paypal account.</p>
<p>Ibotta works best for grocery items. It has partnered with large national grocery chains, and is even working with stores such as <a href="https://www.7-eleven.com" target="_blank">7-Eleven</a> and <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com" target="_blank">Whole Foods Market</a>. The offers are similar from store to store, so it’s really a matter of where you want to shop to redeem them.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Ibotta gives first-time users a nice cash bonus and is surprisingly easy and quick to use.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dealnews-app/id405566099" target="_blank">DealNews:</a> Black Friday help</h2>
<p>The Black Friday app from <a href="http://Dealnews.com" target="_blank">Dealnews.com</a> for iPhones and Androids allows you to browse leaked and published advertisements from 60 major retailers. <b>If you search for a particular item,</b> it will reveal comparable deals online and offline, so you&#8217;ll always know if you&#8217;re getting the best deal on Black Friday.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Use the app to save specific deals to your list for future reference and search store ads quickly and easily instead of carrying around an armload of circulars from the newspaper on Black Friday.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/retailmenot-coupons/id521207075" target="_blank">Retailmenot</a>: Additional store discounts</h2>
<p>The new app for iPhone and Android allows you to simply show your coupon on your phone to a store clerk to redeem savings. If you&#8217;re about to go shopping at a specific store, you&#8217;ll want to quickly search for additional savings you can get while you are there; if you&#8217;re going to the mall, the app can also show you deals nearby.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Never check out without checking for an additional discounts from this app first.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redlaser-barcode-scanner-shopping/id474902001" target="_blank">RedLaser:</a> Location-based price-checking</h2>
<p>This one is a must for location-based shopping as both a price checker and a deal finder. Scan bar codes and QR codes to discover if a better price on a specific item is nearby or online. The app allows you to also purchase through the app. The latest update to the app includes in-store deals, store maps and store circulars.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Always scan the in-store price, especially for a large brand name or big-ticket purchase, to make sure you are getting the best price.</p>
<h2><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hukkster/id592307314" target="_blank">Hukkster</a>, for best price alerts</h2>
<p>Download Hukkster to your iPhone or iPad and start browsing. When you see an item you like, press the &#8220;Hukk button,&#8221; which saves the product to an alert list. Hukkster will alert you when the item goes on sale, which is great for gift-list shopping and big-ticket item purchases.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Saying &#8220;Hukk it&#8221; is fun. Getting stuff cheaper is really fun.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.&#8221;<br />
— Voltaire</p></blockquote>
<p>You probably have your own precious Thanksgiving Day traditions, but we wanted to share some stories that touched our hearts.</p>
<h2>Never forget the green Jell-O salad</h2>
<p>“Every year, about 20 of us would gather around my grandparents’ kitchen table for Thanksgiving dinner. The table would be covered with food: turkey, stuffing, multiple bowls of mashed potatoes, corn, green bean casserole, sweet potato casserole, rolls, shrimp cocktail and more. Usually about half way through the meal with plates already loaded up, my grandmother — one of the most important women in my life — would realize she forgot about the green Jell-O salad in the fridge. Several people would have to get up from the table and move their chairs to open the fridge to get it out. She would insist we all eat some, even though we were already stuffed and didn&#8217;t really like Jell-O salad.</p>
<p>“My grandmother died five years ago. And you better believe, whether we like it or not, we always make sure there&#8217;s green Jell-O at Thanksgiving!”</p>
<p><i>—Tiffany Saunders, Ashland, Ohio</i></p>
<h2>Black Friday shopping ninjas</h2>
<p>“Even though my two sisters and I have moved away from our hometown in North Carolina, every single year the three of us travel home for Thanksgiving Day with mom and our yearly Black Friday shopping contest. We&#8217;ve been doing it all our lives and look forward to spending our time together after the meal with the Black Friday newspaper ads spread all over the place plotting our shopping strategy. We all always sleep at mom&#8217;s so no one will be late. The most fun is that once the shopping is done, we have a contest: Whomever saved the most money and got the best deal gets her big, after-shopping meal paid for by the rest of us!”</p>
<p><i>—Pat Stone Smith, Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.</i></p>
<h2>Turkey with a side of molé</h2>
<p>&#8220;My grandmother is from Oxaca, Mexico, and she makes the best homemade molé I&#8217;ve ever had, and even serves it with holiday turkey. As a professional chef now, I&#8217;m sad to say I was so young when she died that she didn&#8217;t have a chance to pass on the recipe. She would serve it on Christmas Day turkey with tomato rice, fresh tortillas, cumin-spiked black beans and extra molé salsa, as it was so good and spicy. But the most important ingredient of this meal that brings me back to grandma and turkey is family and a large helping of love. (I think the real secret ingredient to my grandma&#8217;s molé might be lots of chicken fat, but I am still experimenting … and mine is still never as good as hers!)&#8221;</p>
<p><i>—David A. Cruz, executive chef/operator Simon Mansion &amp; Supper Club|Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic</i></p>
<h2>Appreciating friends, family out loud</h2>
<p>Christine Carter, a sociologist and happiness expert at University of California Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, shared her own fantastic traditions on her <a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/raising_happiness" target="_blank">Raising Happiness</a> blog:</p>
<p><b>Friends:</b> &#8220;Every year my friends travel to a small town in Northern California the weekend before Thanksgiving to celebrate together. The core members of this group have been gathering like this for more than 20 years! The highlight of the weekend comes during our Thanksgiving dinner when everyone gives a toast to the past year, and of course what they feel grateful for.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends are a particularly appreciative bunch, and the go-around the table can often last an hour or more. The main focus, year after year, is on the others at the table. Husbands give tearful tributes to their wives; friends detail all the ways that people at the table supported them through surgeries, kid mishaps and job changes. Most people only hear toasts like these at their weddings — or they never hear them at all, as often we only celebrate people so publicly in memoriam, when the person being honored is no longer alive to revel in the love of their friends.</p>
<p><b>Family:</b> &#8220;My young kids fold pieces of construction paper in half, and make them into humongous place cards, gluing leaves to the front and doing their best to spell everyone’s names inside. Then, when the turkey is still in the oven, each family member finds time to sneak away from football and silently saddle up to the dining room table. There they write on the inside of the place cards, noting what they are thankful for about each person named on the front of the card.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Thanksgiving dinner, we go around the table and read out loud one or two things that someone else has written about us. What I love about this is that there is both a private and a public component to our gratitude.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/112513-PushPenny-MultitaskingShoppers.jpg" alt="112513-PushPenny-MultitaskingShoppers" width="600" height="467" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-552" />Cell phones, alcohol and footwear can have a significant influence on your pocketbook. What do they all have in common?</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are distracted while shopping, it can have a serious negative impact on your shopping dollars,&#8221; says savings expert, Andrea Woroch. &#8220;Whether brought on by your own actions or influenced by the retailers, your mobile device and your shopping habits may be leading you to spend more,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>There is research to prove that theory. Woroch says, &#8220;In order to save money and shop smart, you have to focus on the shopping at hand, and nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Steer clear of store parties</h2>
<p>A recent study in the Journal of Marketing Research confirmed that relaxed shoppers were willing to pay up to 15 percent more than less-relaxed shoppers. Researchers helped relax subjects by using video and music in six different experiments. The study reports shoppers focused less on price or specific features and more on the benefits of owning the item. And that&#8217;s exactly the purpose of holiday store parties. With a glass of wine or champagne, a much stronger relaxant then the nature videos or the music the researchers used in the study, retailers hope you are more willing to spend more money than what you expected when you walked through the door.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t shop, talk and text</h2>
<p>With recent state laws prohibiting texting and/or talking on a cell phone while driving, you might wonder what other activities are affected by cell phone use. Another recent study from the School of Health Technology and Management at Stony Brook University in New York found that texting and talking on a cell phone while walking results in walking errors and could interfere with memory recall.</p>
<p>Woroch says shoppers can easily be distracted by text messages, emails and phone calls. &#8220;These can cause you to overlook sale signs, forget to use or comply properly with coupons and simply pick up things not on your list, which all leads to overspending. Sticking to a shopping budget with a planned coupon list takes attention to detail,&#8221; she says.

<h2>Keep your eye on the prize</h2>
<p>While tapping into your smartphone to access mobile coupons or compare prices, you could be tempted to make an unplanned purchase, Woroch says. Another study published by the American Marketing Association has proven the theory: The more time you spend in a store walking around outside the path of your shopping list, the more you spend, especially when tempted by promotions that pop up on your phone.</p>
<p>The researchers knew what shoppers planned to purchase before walking into the store and used radio frequency identification tracking to conduct the field experiment. They tested the effect of consumers’ walking path through a store when smartphones, with location-based mobile promotion apps such as FourSquare, display users deals and savings in the store. Then researchers compared their receipts with the original shopping lists.</p>
<p>The experiment found that consumers, on average, overspent $13.83 when a coupon popped up on their phone that required them to walk near their planned shopping list path, but a mobile coupon requiring shoppers to walk through the store and away from their planned path increased overspending to $21.29. Every 55 feet outside the unplanned path added $1 to unplanned spending. </p>
<h2>Wear high heels</h2>
<p>A new study by two Brigham Young University marketing professors reveals that shoppers who wear high heels while shopping are more likely to make sensible decisions and not overspend. That&#8217;s because wearing heels gives you a heightened sense of balance so you&#8217;re less likely to stand in uncomfortable shoes or walk around the store beyond than what’s necessary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/112213-PushPenny-TDayShopping1.jpg" alt="112213-PushPenny-TDayShopping1" width="600" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-546" />Whether you agree with it or not, Thanksgiving Day is now an official shopping day. More than 20 major retailers will be open on Thursday and Black Friday. Last year, when only a handful of stores were open on Thanksgiving Day, more than 35 million were roaming the aisles, according to the National Retail Federation 2012 survey. Twenty-eight percent of those who shopped during Black Friday weekend were at stores by midnight on Thanksgiving, up 24 percent in 2011 and 10 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to shop on Thanksgiving Day, here are store hours for 10 top Black Friday destinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wal-Mart: 6 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Target: 8 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Best Buy: 6 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Sports Authority: 6 p.m.-midnight Thursday; 6 a.m. through Black Friday</li>
<li>Macy&#8217;s: 8 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday hours depend on location</li>
<li>Kohl&#8217;s: 8 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>JC Penney: 8 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Sears: 8 p.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Staples: 8 p.m.-midnight; opens 6 a.m. Black Friday</li>
<li>Toys ‘R’ Us: 5 p.m.- Black Friday hours depend on location</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bonus: Two stores open early on Thanksgiving Day</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Kmart: 6 a.m. Thursday-Black Friday</li>
<li>Old Navy: 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. Thursday; opens again at 7 p.m.-Black Friday</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Take it</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Guaranteed door busters:</b> Be at the store during the hours advertised for door busters. Wal-Mart has increased its list of guaranteed door busters for customers who follow the rules and will give you a voucher for any sold-out item.</li>
<li><b>Discounted Apple products:</b> It&#8217;s widely known that Apple is stingy on discounts, but authorized sellers are undercutting it. Wal-Mart, for example, is offering a $100 gift card for the purchase of a regularly-priced Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi 16GB (in two colors) for $299 and a $75 gift card for the purchase of an Apple iPhone 5C 16GB smartphone for $45.</li>
<li><b>Bundled gaming systems:</b> You may not be able to score (due to very limited supplies, already sold out) or afford an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4, but you can find fantastic bundled deals for last year&#8217;s gaming systems. A PlayStation 3 game console with the &#8220;Move&#8221; bundle including a controller and a game costs $249 at BestBuy, while the PS4 system alone costs $399 and bundles cost over $500, even at Wal-Mart. </li>
<li><b>Deals on large appliances:</b> Websites such as Sears, Lowe&#8217;s and The Home Depot will offer some of their best deals of the year on dishwashers, ovens and washers and dryers, reports Dealnews.com, who tracked sale prices throughout the holidays last year. It pays to check regular prices now and look for deals if your significant other has his or her heart set on a new dishwasher, washer and dryer, vacuum cleaner (Hoover took 30 percent off site-wide last year) or any small kitchen appliances (under $10 even).</li>
<li><b>Tools also on sale:</b> Dealnews.com also predicts that Black Friday will be the best time to buy drills, wrenches, socket sets, tool storage units and more from stores such as The Home Depot, Lowe&#8217;s, Sears and Kmart.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Leave it</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>No-name gift baskets and sets:</b> These are called &#8220;fillers&#8221; in the retail industry. That&#8217;s because retailers rely on these high-margin, unbranded item purchases to fund the door-buster discounts on electronics, says James Dion, president of Dionco, a retail-consulting firm in Chicago. These items could be no-name food, toiletry, bath and skincare gift sets or baskets. Other options include private label or exclusive store brand bundles such as cookware, kitchen utensil or even bedding sets that may be of poorer quality. Keep in mind you can&#8217;t price check these because they are typically unbranded and exclusive only to that store. Even though the gift baskets are packaged nicely, it may be cheaper to create your own.</li>
<li><b>Luxury items: </b>Dion says designer brand names don&#8217;t usually participate in Black Friday discounts, so it&#8217;s wise to look carefully at any exclusions for any coupon you might want to use on Black Friday. However, the exception at is the designer brand outlet stores, which typically offer deeper storewide discounts on Black Friday than any other time of the year.</li>
<li><b>Toys: </b>Even though you&#8217;ll see lots of Black Friday deals for toys, its usually better to wait until the first two weeks of December to purchase toys when discounts were steeper last year, reports Dealnews.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Black Friday deals are also available online and most retailers will be offering site-wide savings discount in addition to free shipping.</p>
<p>The most important thing, says Dion, is to check the retail and sale prices of the items on your gift list now to know whether you are getting a deal on Black Friday. Also, before heading out, be sure and double-check the Black Friday deal requirements. Some stores are offering specific deals on Thanksgiving Day and different sales on Black Friday. Lastly, know the model numbers, sizes, styles and prices so you&#8217;ll be able to easily spot the best Black Friday deals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-540" alt="111513-PushPenny-Toys" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111513-PushPenny-Toys.jpg" width="625" height="500" />If a tablet or a smartphone is at the top of your kids&#8217; holiday wish list this year, you aren&#8217;t alone. According to a recent report from the NPD Group titled &#8220;Kids and Apps: A New Era of Play,&#8221; 79 percent of 2,248 parents with children ages 2 to 14 report that they or their children own a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, for the child to use. That&#8217;s up from 63 percent last year and that figure is only expected to grow. This year’s survey update revealed that 51 percent of children are now using smart devices and nearly 40 percent of the kids represented in the survey are considered a primary user of the device.</p>
<p>The report also found that children don&#8217;t use these devices to replace other activities but they multi-task with them, such as browsing the tablet while watching TV. The number of activities children do on smart devices was also found to be increasing. Games were the favorite activity for 87 percent of children.</p>
<p>If you have reservations about buying a device for your child, it&#8217;s not a choice to be made lightly, according to <a href="http://www.drsophiap.com/About_Dr._Sophia_P.html" target="_blank">Sophia Pierroutsakos</a>, a screen-time expert, speaker on family wellness and child development and professor of psychology at St. Louis Community College.</p>
<h2>Think gift choices through</h2>
<p>The amount of screen time with gadgets such as smartphones, game consoles and tablets should be regulated, especially the younger they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a developmental psychologist and as a parent of a 4-year-old and an 11-year-old, I recommend thinking hard about why you are spending your money on it, how your family will use it and how you will regulate it before buying anything,&#8221; Pierroutsakos says.</p>
<h2>Toys versus screens</h2>
<p>&#8220;If &#8216;screen&#8217; toys don&#8217;t fit with your family goals or your budget, then simply choose not to give it,&#8221; Pierroutsakos says. &#8220;You can take it off the list and ask kids what else they want.&#8221; She says giving something you can&#8217;t afford (or puts you in credit card debt into next year) or aren&#8217;t prepared to handle isn&#8217;t the best idea. &#8220;I advise parents spend money on things that will bring you together instead of apart. If you think a tablet or a smartphone will help you come together as a family and you are prepared to regulate their use – then buy it,&#8221; she advises.</p>
<p><strong>Save money on toys:</strong> According to the deal-tracking website <a href="http://Dealnews.com" target="_blank">Dealnews.com</a>, skip Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts in favor of the deeper toy discounts, especially on toys from the Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=10811023&amp;camp=ppc:432729281&amp;affcode=2729281&amp;searchdef=2194806&amp;k_clickid=63d6ed94-7762-4d30-ae9b-561857dc0787&amp;002=2194806&amp;006=35948522806&amp;007=Search&amp;008=&amp;009=b&amp;012=_cat:toysrus.com&amp;021=27445565539" target="_blank">&#8220;Fabulous 15&#8243;</a> list, you will find during first two weeks of December. Prices dropped 37 percent on other basic toys such as LEGOs and other classic toys in December last year. The one exception is <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">LeapFrog</a>, whose prices actually rose during the same time period.</p>
<p><strong>Save money on iPhones and iPads and other electronics:</strong> Dealnews.com reports that the iPad 4 price may fall to around $399 (the same price as the new iPad mini with Retina display and the iPad 2). <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> usually discounts 5 percent to 10 percent on Black Friday, but other authorized sellers such as <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.macmall.com" target="_blank">MacMall</a> and <a href="http://www.macconnection.com" target="_blank">MacConnection</a> may offer discounts up to 20 percent. Get to know the regular, retail prices now for any electronics you might want so you can spot Black Friday deals.</p>
<p><strong>Save money on gaming consoles:</strong> Opt for a bundled console deal that includes extras such as controllers and game titles you want, which were discounted last year 30 percent to 40 percent off their retail prices, according Dealnews.com. Don&#8217;t expect any discounts on the new Xbox One or PlayStation 4, which will be in short supply.</p>
<h2>Give experiences instead of stuff</h2>
<p>&#8220;Part of the holidays is giving your kids joy … and they don&#8217;t always know themselves what that is. Most of all, kids still want your time and attention. Money spent on experiences, even if they don&#8217;t go as planned, are always learning opportunities and memories for your child&#8217;s heart and mind,&#8221; Pierroutsakos advises.</p>
<p><strong>Save money on experiences:</strong> <a href="http://www.groupon.com" target="_blank">Groupon</a> or <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com" target="_blank">Living Social</a> is a great way to buy experiences for activities you can do together on the cheap. You can find deals for all sorts of fun activities such as high tea, trampoline gyms, kid&#8217;s cooking classes, exercise classes, nail spas, horseback riding and even museums, sporting events and tourist attractions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/112513-PushPenny-QuickDecorFixes.jpg" alt="112513-PushPenny-QuickDecorFixes" width="600" height="579" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-522" />While you are preparing for visitors this holiday season, make sure your home reads ready — not wreck! Don’t abandon your hosting duties if you don’t have time or resources to renovate. Robin Callan of <a href="http://www.roomfu.com/blog" target="_blank">Room Fu</a>, sports a “black belt in bad-ass design.” The former creative director turned interior guru now helps people “navigate the challenging issues of remodeling” within a budget. Before the in-laws come knocking, here are Callan’s quick fix décor solutions to spruce up your abode for $50 or less. </p>
<h2>Tip 1: Tackle</h2>
<p>Tackle the area that your visitors will inhabit first. Set an alarm to organize the space for an hour and reward yourself once the task is complete. “Have comfortable linens, a reading lamp and a water pitcher on the night stand, Callan says. RemoveAndReplace.com offers some DIY options for <a href="http://removeandreplace.com/2013/04/17/elegant-diy-lamps-created-for-under-50-dollars-using-recycled-parts/" target="_blank">lamps for under $50</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;Good black out curtains are always helpful for guests who may have trouble sleeping.” Stock the bathroom with lotion, bath salts, an extra toothbrush and robe, she says. “Give them that hotel or spa retreat experience. You can get trial-sized things for little money. Put a tree branch in a vase in the bathroom. Just having that natural element takes you a long way.” </p>
<h2>Tip 2: Tweak</h2>
<p>Minor tweaks can transform a room from drab to fab. Callan emphasizes, &#8220;I’m a big fan of alternative color palettes for the holidays.” Add an accent color to your living room space by pulling from the colors of your Christmas ornaments. “Maybe that’s just 2 pillows,” she adds. <a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/search.do?query=pillows" target="_blank">World Market</a> offers a chic selection of pillows for under $30. </p>
<p>Flip off the overhead switch and use low ambient light when entertaining. “A really fun statement lamp makes a big difference. I go for big, chunky, colorful vases in simplified forms. When you get that shot of color in an unexpected place, it feels like a huge upgrade. <a href="http://www.homegoods.com/blog/2011/10/06/update-your-space-with-colorful-lamps-and-shades/" target="_blank">Home Goods</a> always has distinctive lamps for a fraction of what you’d pay elsewhere.” </p>
<h2>Tip 3: Paint</h2>
<p>Want to attract prosperity in the New Year? Slap on a coat of courage. “There’s a lot that goes into the psychology of color and how it affects you,” says Callan. “I had a client who was a painter.” She neglected her craft for many years. After Room Fu re-painted her home, “her space felt much more personalized. It inspired her to start pursing creative outlets again. For $50 you could paint a whole room. If you’re scared of color, bump up your shade 2 notches on the color strip. It will be a shock for the first 2 weeks, but if you can just sit tight with it, you’ll be surprised.”</p>
<h2>Tip 4: Flow</h2>
<p>Establish a harmonious flow. The decorator explains, “In a bedroom, the first place I want to try putting the bed is opposite the door. So that when you’re laying in bed you have a clear view of the door. That’s good for both the inhabitant and the visitor. When you enter the bedroom, you see the bed in all it’s splendor.” </p>
<h2>Tip 5: Utilize</h2>
<p>Instead of dreaming of a walk-in closet, utilize hidden space. “A typical closet has 1 rod and 1 shelf above it. Even if you have a bunch of things hanging, (there‘s) all of this space from hip level down that doesn’t get used. With metro shelves from <a href="http://www.target.com/p/whitmor-supreme-small-3-tier-shelving-chrome/-/A-13259934?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&#038;AFID=Google_PLA_df&#038;LNM=%7C13259934&#038;CPNG=Furniture&#038;kpid=13259934&#038;LID=PA&#038;ci_src=17588969&#038;ci_sku=13259934&#038;gclid=CJzZrOPR57oCFcQb4godq0IADA" target="_blank">Target</a> you can add bins and take advantage of vertical storage in your closet. I created a butler’s pantry in my laundry room, (in) an alcove under the stairs. I found used bookshelves on Craigslist for $10, for my cookbooks, small appliances and table linens. Everything has a place.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/110813-PushPenny-TaxTips.jpg" alt="110813-PushPenny-TaxTips" width="650" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-517" />The end of the year is looming and before you know it, Uncle Sam will expect you to file your taxes. Now is the best time to take stock of your tax situation.</p>
<p>“Once January hits — with limited exceptions — it’s too late to take advantage of tax deductions for this year,” says tax attorney and former IRS special agent <a href="http://julianblocktaxexpert.com/" target="_blank">Julian Block</a>, who has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Julian-Block/e/B001K8SPDK/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1" target="_blank">written several books</a> on income tax. “Now is the perfect time to make strategic moves in order to save as much money as possible on this year’s tax return.”</p>
<p>Help ensure that April 15th comes and goes without a hitch by keeping the following tips in mind.</p>
<h2>Decide on year-end charitable donations</h2>
<p>The standard advice is to make donations to charities in December to take advantage of the tax break on next year’s tax return. But Block advises to determine what type of return you’ll be filing before pulling out your checkbook.</p>
<p>In general there are two types of tax filings: itemizing every tax deduction or choosing a standard deduction, which is determined by the federal government. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc501.html" target="_blank">Internal Revenue Service</a> can help you decide whether you should itemize deductions. </p>
<p>“If you’ll be itemizing for 2013, then make as many donations as possible by the end of the year. But if you’re going to take standard deductions and not itemize, then don’t make those donations before the close of 2013, because you can’t write them off and they’ll be wasted,” he says. “Hold off making donations until 2014 when you can get a tax break if you itemize.”</p>
<h2>Include charitable contribution expenses</h2>
<p>Besides the checks you write to charities, the expenses you incur volunteering are also tax deductible when you itemize, Block says. Allowable write-offs for your good deeds include out-of-pocket unreimbursed expenses, such as travel costs (train, bus and plane), gas, tolls and parking.</p>
<h2>Consider end-of-year medical expenses</h2>
<p>If you’ll be itemizing this year’s tax return, now is the time to make an appointment for the dentist, doctor or ophthalmologist you’ve been putting off. However, add up your medical expenses so far this year to make sure you’ll reach the necessary threshold.</p>
<p>If you are going to itemize, tax guidelines currently state that you can write off any medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income, and 7.5 percent if you are older than 65, Block says. “If your planned medical expenses won’t push you over the 7.5 or 10 percent mark, there isn’t any good tax reason to do them. You’d be better off waiting until January and claiming them on the following year’s taxes.”</p>
<p>If you do end up making that appointment, you’ll also have to pay the bill by the end of the year for these expenses to qualify for this year’s tax return.</p>
<h2>Check state tax totals</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to determine if you&#8217;ve paid sufficient state tax for the year in order to avoid penalties. To do so, consult your most recent paystub. Take your current gross income for the year and subtract from it any deductions you’ve paid so far (medical expenses, charitable contributions, real estate taxes, mortgage interest, state income taxes and state sales taxes). This gives you your taxable income. Multiply this figure by your applicable state tax rate, which you can find by searching on your state’s tax board page. The resulting amount will be what you owe in state taxes.*</p>
<p>If you haven’t paid sufficient state tax and you’re employed by a company, adjust your tax deductions on your W-4 so more taxes are taken out through the rest of the year. If you’re self-employed, pay more estimated tax before the end of the year to make up the difference. In order to avoid penalties, which vary by state, you must pay at least 90 percent of this year’s calculated state tax liability or the same amount you paid last year.</p>
<p><em>*If you prefer not to do any calculations and your pay and deductions are similar to last year, simply make sure that you’re paying the same amount in state taxes this year. You can do this by comparing your most recent paystub to one during the same time period last year.</em></p>
<h2>Get organized</h2>
<p>Take time now to look for and record all of your deductions. “Tend to this organization task by the end of the year while the year’s expenditures are still fresh in your mind,” Block says. “It will be easier to remember what you spent, and you’ll be less likely to overlook any deductions.”</p>
<p>If you compile all of your documentation now, you won’t have to wait until April 15th to submit your tax return. And the earlier you submit in the new year, the faster you’ll receive your much welcome refund.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111513-PushPenny-OrganicTradeAssociation.jpg" alt="111513-PushPenny-OrganicTradeAssociation" width="600" height="345" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-511" />Eating right is no picnic. It’s not cheap either, especially if you want to buy organic food. In fact, while there’s a tremendous momentum for organic sales, which spiked 10 percent in 2012 from the previous year, the overwhelming reason consumers say they don’t purchase organic is that it’s too expensive, according to Laura Batcha, a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ota.com/index.html" target="_blank">Organic Trade Association</a> (OTA), in Brattleboro, Vermont.</p>
<p>Buying organic <em>can</em> cost more than conventional foods. OTA surveyed 639 U.S. households and 600 members of KIWI magazine’s Parents’ Advisory Board and released its results in the U.S. Families’ Organic Attitude &#038; Beliefs 2013 study. It shows parents who buy organic food spend more a week on groceries (an average of $119) than parents who don’t buy organic ($104). Yet, “there are many ways families can enjoy all organic meals every day for about the same cost as conventionally produced food,” Batcha says. We’re talking all organic, not just a few items here and there. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Watch for in-store specials.</strong> To maximize savings, pick up the in-store flyer at your local organic foods store, such <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com" target="_blank">Whole Foods Market</a>, before you shop. Come equipped with a shopping list and stock up on savings by buying enough sale items for several meals. Price-check several local grocery stores for often-purchased organic items to find the lowest prices. A site such as <a href="http://www.mysupermarket.com" target="_blank">www.Mysupermarket.com</a> is an easy way to comparison grocery shop.  </p>
<p><strong>Buy in bulk or by the case.</strong> Buy flour, legumes, oats, nuts and spices from the bin (you save<br />
by doing your own packaging). PushPenny <a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/2013/11/18/purchase-cooking-baking-staples-now/" target="_blank">reported last week</a> that November is a good time to stock up on baking staples because stores advertise sales and deals for the holidays. </p>
<p><strong>Plan meals for a month out.</strong> In general, the OTA says consumers should have keep a well-<br />
stocked pantry and plan meals for the month, not just a week at a time. When you’ve got lots of staples around, such as organic spices, oils, nuts, dried beans, flour/grain and frozen produce that you’ve purchased on sale, it’s easier to round out your recipes with perishable ingredients, such as fresh vegetables, meat and milk. And when organic meat and fish goes on sale, stock your freezer.       </p>
<p><strong>Take home the house or generic brand. </strong>Similar to conventional supermarkets, many organic foods stores such as Whole Foods Market carry their own line of products — everything from pasta sauce and cereal to olive oil. Because the federal government regulates the organic certification, private label organic products must be held to the same standard as organic branded products. And, in general, the quality of private label products now rival branded products. Private label products can cost as much as 30 percent less. </p>
<p><strong>Shop in season.</strong> This general savings rule of thumb applies to organic produce, too. Organic apples, for example, can be much less expensive when you buy them at peak season (fall) than at any other time of the year. Lock in the savings by freezing seasonal produce for use later. In June, which is berry season, buy as many fresh blueberries as your freezer space can hold. </p>
<p><strong>Clip or download coupons.</strong> On average, two in 10 families report they “always buy” organic, with fruits, vegetables and dairy leading the way, according to OTA. That means there are still a lot of families who aren’t buying organic, always or ever. To lure more consumers, organic manufacturers frequently offer high-value coupons. Try calling the company or posting on its Facebook page to request the coupon, says OTA’s Batcha. By “high-value,” we’re talking free, as in one free <a href="http://www.stonyfield.com/products/baby-kids/yokids/smoothies-strawbana" target="_blank">Stonyfield YoKids Organic Smoothie Pack</a> or one free <a href="http://www.horizondairy.com" target="_blank">Horizon product</a> up to $4.99, which are two coupons available now that expire on Dec. 31. To take advantage of these offers, you have to register with each company to receive more offers via email. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/112613-PushPenny-VeganBudget.jpg" alt="112613-PushPenny-VeganBudget" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter wp-image-492" /><br />
Whether you’re bringing a casserole to a holiday potluck or inviting everyone to your house for a festive feast, serving meatless options can help you save on your food bill — and stretch your holiday dollar.</p>
<p>“When you’re not including meat, you automatically save money because meat tends to be the most expensive ingredient,” says <a href="http://jillskeem.com" target="_blank">Jill Skeem</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Food-Gets-Vegan-Makeover/dp/0988658801/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1384776000&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=Comfort+Food+Gets+a+Makeover" target="_blank">“Comfort Food Gets a Makeover.”</a></p>
<p>How much can you save by going meatless? Skeem recently did a cost comparison between traditional meat lasagna and the spinach, mushroom, onion option she features in her cookbook, which doesn’t even include cheese (though you can add it to the recipe if you want to). To serve 15 people, Skeem calculated that a lasagna made with ground beef, ricotta and mozzarella costs around $34; her veggie lasagna costs just $17. This is a savings of 50 percent. &#8220;The trick is to make your veggie dishes so delicious that no one will miss the meat — or realize that you cut corners,&#8221; Skeem says. </p>
<p>Smart, money-saving substitutes start with appetizers. Instead of serving pigs in a blanket, make your own <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Hummus-237832" target="_blank">hummus</a> with chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, salt and pepper and other spices, such as cumin. At just pennies per serving, beans are a basic cost cutter. Serve it with crudité. Plan to use the leftover carrots and celery in a stir fry. In fact, why not plan to serve your guests leftovers? If you’ve got leftover rice around, for example, serve fried rice. Plan your menu around what you have on hand and “repurpose everything,” Skeem says. </p>
<p>Think seasonally too. Butternut squash is plentiful this time of year. A five pound squash can cost as little as $2.50. As a first course, think butternut squash soup, not pricey shrimp bisque. Want more holiday meal ideas? Here are two of Skeem’s vegetarian party-friendly recipes that can get you started. You can feel good about serving vegetarian fare not just because it is budget friendly. “When beans, tofu and grains substitute for meat, your guests eat healthier too,” Skeem says.</p>
<h3>Jill Skeem&#8217;s Lasagna with Spinach, Mushroom &#038; Onion </h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />
12 sheets lasagna noodles<br />
2 10 oz. boxes frozen chopped spinach, defrosted<br />
1 16 oz. block tofu, extra-firm<br />
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, oil packed<br />
1/2 cup kalamata olives, pitted<br />
3/4 cup, fresh basil<br />
5 cups mushrooms, sliced<br />
4 cups onions, finely sliced half moons<br />
Sea salt<br />
Black pepper<br />
Olive oil<br />
4 cups marinara sauce </p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong><br />
Place uncooked lasagna noodle sheets in a large baking dish, cover with boiling water for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place a cotton kitchen towel in a bowl; empty spinach into towel, wrap tightly and squeeze out excess liquid. Then, in a food processor, blend tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, 3/4 cup basil, 1 tsp. sea salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. Add 1 tsp. olive oil. Pulse until well blended and has paste-like consistency. Set aside. </p>
<p>Heat oil in large skillet and sauté onions, mushrooms and spinach separately with large pinches of salt and pepper. When spinach is almost done, add cooked onions and mushrooms and sauté together 1 to 2 minutes to combine. Place mixture in bowl and let cool before building lasagna. </p>
<p>To compile the lasagna, pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup marinara sauce on bottom of a 9&#215;13 baking dish. Place 3 pasta sheets on top of sauce. Spread one third tofu mixture on pasta, then spread one-third spinach mixture on top of tofu. Spread 1 cup marinara sauce on top of spinach mixture. Repeat the sequence two more times. Top with last 3 pasta sheets and 1 cup marinara sauce. Cover with foil and bake 45 to 50 minutes. Garnish with fresh basil and let stand 15 minutes before serving. </p>
<h3>Party Vegetable Fried Rice</h3>
<p>Serves 4; if you have more guests coming, double or triple the recipe<br />
<strong>Instructions</strong><br />
1 Tbsp. light sesame or olive oil<br />
1/2 cup onions, diced<br />
Sea salt<br />
1/2 cup carrots, diced<br />
1/2 cup diced celery, peas, mushrooms or any combo vegetables<br />
2 cups, leftover brown or white rice<br />
1/4-1/2 C water<br />
Soy sauce<br />
1 Tbsp. ginger juice, freshly grated<br />
1/4 cup scallions, finely sliced as a garnish</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong><br />
Heat olive oil in a medium skillet. Add onions with pinch of sea salt and sauté 1 to 2 minutes. Add additional vegetables separately; sauté 1 to 2 minutes before adding each veggie. </p>
<p>Place rice on top of sautéed vegetables; add water, cover and simmer 5 to 7 minutes. Check to see if rice is getting soft. If it is, add 1/2 tsp. soy sauce, stir well. Cover, sauté another 5 minutes until rice is sticky. Then add ginger juice, stir and garnish with scallions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111813-PushPenny-HolidayFeastItems.jpg" alt="111813-PushPenny-HolidayFeastItems" width="600" height="314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483" />Do you use oil, salt, sugar, extracts, baking powder, spices, cornstarch, yeast, pie crusts, chocolate morsels, canned and frozen vegetables, butter, cream cheese, cake mix, parchment paper and tinfoil throughout the year? Well, now&#8217;s the time to stock up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year, at the beginning of November, retailers start advertising sales and deals on these holiday feast ingredients, and manufacturers distribute their coupons for these items,&#8221; says Stephanie Nelson, founder of <a href="http://www.CouponMom.com" target="_blank">CouponMom.com</a>. &#8220;You put the two together and you can stock up on these ingredients until well into next year for the cheapest prices of the year.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How to coupon</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start with the Sunday newspaper and clip at least two coupons (preferably more) from the inserts for items you use. Find more coupons online at <a href="http://www.Smartsource.com" target="_blank">Smartsource.com</a>, <a href="http://www.Redplum.com" target="_blank">Redplum.com</a> and <a href="http://www.CouponMom.com" target="_blank">CouponMom.com</a> as well as in advertisements distributed by the stores.</li>
<li>Look for sale prices, special promotions and deals, BOGOs (buy-one-get-one-free), two-for-one items and 10 items for $10.</li>
<li>Then match up the coupons with the sales and deals. While it is tempting to take advantage of all of the potential savings, you only want to purchase items you know you will use.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Digital downloads</h2>
<p>Did you know that many grocery stores offer digital coupons? Take advantage, Nelson says. &#8220;The beauty of these digital coupons is that it&#8217;s an extra free coupon.&#8221;</p>
<p>You will likely have to create an account on each grocer&#8217;s website, which will then be linked to your discount card. Once you are logged into the  website, you can add digital coupons to your account. When you present your discount card in the checkout aisle, the coupons will automatically be applied when the item is scanned.</p>
<p>If you are having a hard time remembering which coupons you digitally stored, you aren&#8217;t alone. Nelson suggests printing a list of coupons when planning your shopping trip and placing the list in the front of your coupon binder for easy access.</p>
<p>For more tips on where to find coupons, watch this video from <a href="http://www.thelemonadeconnection.com" target="_blank">The Lemonade Connection</a>.

<h2>Pick up produce</h2>
<p>Be on the lookout for BOGO or two-for-one sales on bagged apples and cranberries and even single pumpkins. You can use them throughout the month of December for baking or make them a part of your holiday home decor. Here&#8217;s how to choose and store these items, thanks to the Utah State University Cooperative Extension:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apples:</strong> The apple season begins at the end of August, so they are freshly picked in October and November, unlike apples bought during the summer, which are likely last year’s stock. Apples keep for several weeks in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator in an unsealed bag. At room temperature, they will shrivel, lose flavor and juicy crispness sooner. Store other fresh produce separately because apples release ethylene gas that can damage other fruits. For baking and cooking in pies or to make fresh applesauce, use Braeburn, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Jonathan or Honeycrisp varieties.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cranberries:</strong> Cranberry harvesting season is October through December. Once purchased, cranberries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to four weeks and used as needed. They can also be frozen: Place in an air-tight freezer bag for up to a year. No thawing is necessary when you want to add them to a recipe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pumpkins:</strong> With a fall harvest, pumpkins are rarely on sale before Halloween. But they are almost always cheaper at a grocery store versus a private farm or church pumpkin patch. Choose a pumpkin that is firm and heavy for its size. Round pumpkins tend to be lighter and less meaty than oblong pumpkins. And always roast the seeds!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get a free turkey</h2>
<p>Check all your local grocery circulars every week for special deals and compare per-pound prices for the type of turkey you want. Look for free turkey deals when spending a certain amount at the store or for buying participating products.</p>
<p>Nelson says your Thanksgiving feast can be your least expensive meal of the year if you shop smart. Using coupons stacked on top of store sales and deals, you&#8217;ll get everything for just a fraction of the regular price.</p>

But, with a recent Mayo Clinic study estimating that nearly 2 million Americans suffer from celiac disease, traditional Thanksgiving meals could be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>“Celiac disease is an auto immune problem,” says nutritionist <a href="http://www.smartnutritionworks.com" target="_blank">Sandra Meyerowitz</a>. “The body rejects gluten as a foreign substance. It’s a protein found in particular grains, wheat, barley, rye and (some) oats. It sees gluten as a trigger and starts fighting it off.”</p>
<p>If you’ve recently boarded the gluten-free train, the thought of sacrificing holiday staples such as pumpkin pie and stuffing may cause your heart to ache more than your stomach. No need to suffer in silence! The rise of celiac has inspired tasty alternatives. Here’s how to prepare a savory, cost-effective, gluten-free Thanksgiving meal.<br />

<h2>Celebrate!</h2>
<p>No adult wants to feel like they’ve been banished to the kids table because of digestion issues. Blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/glutenfreegirl" target="_blank">Shauna Ahern</a> of <a href="http://glutenfreegirl.com" target="_blank">Gluten-Free Girl</a> suggests organizing a potluck to get everyone involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of women have a hard time expressing why they have to be gluten-free,&#8221; Ahern says. &#8220;Turn it in into a joyful celebration. Most of the traditional dishes are gluten free: turkey (minus the gravy), mashed potatoes and cranberries.”</p>
<p>If you’re a guest, bring sharable dishes “that no one would notice that gluten is missing. Gluten-free cornbread stuffing is always a big hit. Bring a delicious dessert,” says gluten-free advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/gfreefun" target="_blank">Erin Smith</a>. Her favorite indulgence is <a href="http://glutenfreefun.blogspot.com/2010/11/happy-thanksgiving-from-gluten-free-fun.html" target="_blank">Apple Crisp</a>.</p>
<h2>Prepare</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.elanaspantry.com" target="_blank">Elana Amsterdam</a>, author of &#8220;The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook&#8221;, thinks in advance when planning meals for her family. “I make my menu a week ahead of time and shop the weekend before.”</p>
<p>If you’re a guest, speak to the host at least a few weeks before the big meal. </p>
<p>“Make sure they understand that your food cannot come in contact with anything that has gluten… . Ask your host if you can make your plate first to avoid any possible cross-contamination,” Smith suggests. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to taste test your new creation. “If you are worried about the flavor of your gluten-free dish, trying making it a few weeks before the holiday feast.” she says.</div><br />
<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>Some gluten-free products are expensive, so planning ahead can also save you some pennies.</p>
<p>“In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, you can save the heels of your gluten-free bread to use to make stuffing. Preserve the bread by freezing it before preparing your stuffing,” encourages Smith. Once the bread is ready, follow Gluten-Free Girl’s quick recipe called <a href="http://glutenfreegirl.com/2006/11/this-is-the-gluten-free-stuffing-we-will-be-eating/" target="_blank">The Gluten-Free Stuffing the Chef and I Will Be Making for Thanksgiving</a>.</p>
<p>Save a few more pennies by opting for pre-made dessert mixes. “These tend to be cheaper than buying individual gluten-free flours and making your own blend. They are also easier to prepare when putting together your gluten-free meal,” Smith says.</p>
<p>Sweet rice flour and almond flour are good options for making gravy. “Try to include other grains like buckwheat, millet and gluten-free oats. It’s nice to have other things to fall back on so that you’re not taking out that whole food group,” Meyerowitz adds.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a video of Whole Foods Executive Chef Brad DeFurio on how to prepare gluten-free gravy</strong>
<p>

<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>Gluten-free experts find joy in recipes that put a twist on tradition. </p>
<p>“People forget that Thanksgiving is a celebration of the harvest. Play with sweet potatoes, squashes and seeds. I love sweet potato gratin. Slice up the sweet potato thick, add in coconut milk and put walnuts and seeds on top. Put it into the oven and bake it,” Ahern suggests. </p>
<p>For a killer dessert, she raves about her <a href="http://glutenfreegirl.com/2012/11/how-to-make-gluten-free-pumpkin-pie-for-thanksgiving/" target="_blank">gluten-free pumpkin pie</a>. “Use roasted pumpkin. Turn it into a puree. Add spices, coconut milk and Chinese 5 spice powder. It keeps people on their toes!”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/110813-PushPenny-EmergencyFund.jpg"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/110813-PushPenny-EmergencyFund.jpg" alt="110813-PushPenny-EmergencyFund" width="600" height="354" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-435" /></a>Emergencies happen. Whether it’s a sudden loss of income, unforeseen medical costs, hefty house repairs or a broken down car, life is full of unexpected budget-busters. And they always come along at the most inconvenient time.</p>
<p>Without an emergency fund, additional expenses can put a huge strain on your finances, says financial adviser and endowment strategist Scott Cramer, president of <a href="http://www.cramerandrauchegger.com/">Cramer &amp; Rauchegger</a>. “A study conducted by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation showed that households with no emergency funds are almost twice as likely to be involved in a foreclosure,” Cramer says.</p>
<p>When disaster strikes, the last thing you want to do is make matters worse by paying for your emergency with credit or loans, says <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnGilfedder" target="_blank">Shawn Gilfedder</a>, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.mcgrawhillfcu.org/home/home">McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union</a>. “Being prepared for the unexpected will minimize stress and maintain financial health during a difficult time.”</p>
<p>Try these tips to stash cash for an emergency fund.</p>
<p><b>1. Earmark your tax refund</b></p>
<p>“For most of us, the one good thing about tax season is the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Refunds/Where's-My-Refund-It's-Quick,-Easy,-and-Secure.">refund</a>; so why not use all or a portion of the extra cash to grow your emergency fund?” suggests Cramer. Gilfedder advises taking action now. “Increase your deductions on your W-4 to give yourself more cash up front, instead of waiting for your tax refund,” he says.</p>
<p><b>2. Seek out the highest interest rates</b></p>
<p>Though it’s common practice to keep your emergency fund in a liquid savings account, savings interest rates are at an all-time low, so it makes more sense to open up certificates of deposit, or a CD.</p>
<p>“Consider using some of your savings to set-up a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/ladders.asp">CD ladder</a> – a series of certificates that mature in sequences of 3 or 6 months out,” Cramer says. “As one set of CDs mature, you can roll that money into a new ladder. Or if you need access to your funds, you could withdraw and not renew the CD.”</p>
<p><b>3.  Automate savings </b></p>
<p>If you wait until the end of the month to transfer money to your savings account, you might not have any left. Instead, have funds automatically removed from your checking account and deposited into your savings account on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Saving $40 once a week may be easier than saving $170 at the end of the month. Either way, you’ll save more than $2,000 in a year.</p>
<p><b>4. Invest surprises</b></p>
<p>When you receive an unexpected cash infusion, such as a bonus, monetary gift or rebate, after you’re done jumping up and down, put at least 50 percent into your emergency fund.</p>
<p><b>5. Cut back on incidentals</b></p>
<p>For one week, write down how much money you spend eating out for lunch, buying gourmet coffee and soda at the vending machine. Cut that amount by 50 to 75 percent and put the money you would have spent on non-essential items into your emergency savings. Saving just $10 a week adds up to $520 in a year.</p>
<p><b>6. Accumulate spare change</b></p>
<p>You’d be amazed at how much money you have jingling around the bottom of your purse or stashed in your car. Each time you pay for something in cash, put the change in a glass jar. Roll the coins every one to two months and deposit the money in your emergency savings account.</p>
<p><b>7. Opt to use cash</b></p>
<p>Whenever possible, use cash, which will help you stick to your budget. If you only have $60 in cash for groceries, you won’t spend that extra $10 that you often do, which adds up to a lot of savings for your emergency account.</p>
<p>Yes, saving for an emergency fund does take some sacrifice, but it’s well-worth knowing you can pay unforeseen bills.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/110813-Pennywyse-BluesBeGone.jpg" alt="110813-Pennywyse-BluesBeGone" width="600" height="267" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-444" />Has the end of daylight savings put a chokehold on your cheery mood? If you’re increasingly sluggish, irritable and have resorted to hibernating — it’s time to get your happy back! Fend off the winter blues with low-cost natural remedies. They can easily be found in your kitchen or at a local health food store.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/seasonal-affective-disorder/DS00195" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>, ‘winter blues,’ medically referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder, is “a type of depression that occurs at the same time every year… . (Symptoms) start in the fall and continue into the winter … sapping your energy.”</p>
<p>Karen Rose is a mother of three, certified herbalist and the owner of <a href="http://www.sacredvibeshealing.com" target="_blank">Sacred Vibes Herbal Apothecary</a> in Brooklyn, New York. Before raiding your medicine cabinets for a remedy, she suggests looking within the kitchen cabinets. </p>
<p>As the temperature drops, your meal selections should heat up. “Don’t consume cold foods,” Rose warns. “Incorporate spices — like cayenne — into your diet, which warm the body. Bring in broths and soups while concentrating on root vegetables… . Oftentimes we reach for sweets when a cup of tea can be very helpful,” she says. Try brews with vanilla, cinnamon and even chocolate. “Just a cup makes a big difference. It’s about educating people, that they have medicine in their cabinets already. With lots of teas, you can add shaved ginger and cinnamon. A lot of meds are found in spices, like cloves, nutmeg, lemon and honey.”</p>
<p>Nutrient-rich, fermented vegetables should not be ignored, the herbalist says. Meal additions such as kimchi, sauerkraut and miso soup can act as super foods — pumping up your energy while warding off disease. A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12813174" target="_blank">2003 study</a> done by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute links the consumption of miso soup with a reduced risk in breast cancer. </p>
<p>Incorporating herbs into your daily regime can also have transformative effects. </p>
<p>“Our DNA is very similar to that of plants. Pharmaceuticals are symptom based. A plant medicine stops the headache and finds out where we need to make up for it. It tries to go to the source of the problem not just the symptom,” Rose says.</p>
<p>If you’re an herbal newbie hoping to kick your blues to the curb, go slow. </p>
<p>“Choose a few and spend time with them,&#8221; Rose suggests. &#8220;They’re like friends. Plants have individual energies like we do. Start with 5 plants: garlic, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger and clove.&#8221; The herbalists says to try and incorporate them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for specialty herbs, explore unique tea combinations. Rose blends herbs with precision in her store. </p>
<p>“A lot of our clients, their moods change when the sunlight changes, so we have (a product called) Here Comes the Sun,” she smiles. The ingredients of the tea, which she <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/40930538/here-comes-the-sun-winter-blue-support?ref=shop_home_active&amp;ga_search_query=here%2Bcomes%2Bthe%2Bsun" target="_blank">sells online</a> for $15, include oat straw, borage leaves, tulsi, lemon verbena and lemongrass. The potent mix helps to “tonify the nervous system, which allows you to feel more in balance. It’s designed for bringing sunshine in when there’s not a lot. It’s really delicious, really lemony. It’s known to break through melancholy (feelings) and lift the spirit.”</p>
<p>Herbal elixirs require a longer seeping time than caffeine-based teas. First, boil the water, pour it over the plant leaves and let it seep for 25 minutes. Rose advises drinking herbal teas 2-3 times daily to brighten your mood.</p>
<p>“It’s so important to talk to people about what a body in balance feels like. If you know the signals when you feel like you’re slipping, you can easily come back.”</p>

<p>With weeks still left before holiday gifting ensues, why not use your time wisely? Save your money and sanity by getting a jumpstart on personalized, homemade holiday gifts now!</p>
<p>Marci Siegel, owner of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Coop28handmade" target="_blank">Co-Op 28</a>, a Los Angeles-based gift shop, sources handmade goods from crafters from around the world. With a collection of unisex finds, she understands why DIY is trending.<br />
​<br />
​“You can’t find what we have anywhere, except from the artist. It’s far from the same old thing,” Siegel says. Her best-sellers, some of which are handmade subway signs and wooden magnets, suggest that crafters and consumers are thinking outside of the box this year when it comes to gifting.</p>
<p>Create personalized presents for the art lover or fashionista on your list by allowing creativity be your guide. Trade in go-to holiday cookies for dynamic DIYs that also push the boundaries on tradition. Here are ideas guaranteed to wow your family for seasons to come.</p>
<h2>For the fashionista</h2>
<p>Faceted gems are a perfect gift for the family stylista. DIY-maker <a href="http://megallancole.com" target="_blank">Meg Allan Cole</a> has a stress free, easy bake recipe that turns clay into coveted gems.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/P4SGcJAeuUI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/P4SGcJAeuUI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Gather colored Sculpey clay, knives and a cutting board. “Take a chunk of clay …. Work it until it’s soft and malleable,” Cole says. Separate them into circles. “Use the knife to trim it’s edges until it resembles a faceted look.” Bake the clay pieces in your oven on a non-stick pan for 15 minutes at 275 degrees. Once cooled, use glue to affix earring backs to the artistic gems.</p>
<h2>For the bookworm</h2>
<p>If they’ve already downloaded &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; trilogy and devoured all of <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/en_US" target="_blank">J.K. Rowling’s</a> novels (even that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/14/world/rowling-secret-book/" target="_blank">not-so-secret &#8220;The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling&#8221;</a>), why not create your own series for the bookworm on your list? Whether you conceptualize a fantasy or drama, make it come to life by creating a book online. Sites such as <a href="http://Blurb.com" target="_blank">Blurb.com</a> and <a href="http://Lulu.com" target="_blank">Lulu.com</a> allow you to customize layouts, scan images and publish, all in less than 2 hours. With an option to print a hard copy or publish an eBook, you can make wedding albums, baby books, cook books or travel journals, starting at $13.</p>
<h2>For the art lover</h2>
<p>Who says you have to liquidate your savings for an enviable body of artwork? Channel your inner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz" target="_blank">Annie Leibovitz</a> by gifting your family  originals from your Instagram feed. Print out and frame candid close-ups on glossy photo paper. You can also affix and glaze the images to wooden coasters, producing a set of unique libation holders.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="480" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/bsX1UbsxrGQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/bsX1UbsxrGQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Surprise mom by giving her a ceramic photo tile to add to her kitchen backsplash or a magnet for her fridge. For $4, upload a Instagram image to <a href="http://www.imagesnap.com" target="_blank">Imagesnap</a> and for a 2X2 tile. For the holiday traveler, send Instagram-inspired postcards or calendars for less than $30. They can be made within minutes and mounted on wood through <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a>. If your shot belongs in a gallery — blow it up! Use <a href="http://canvaspop.com" target="_blank">Canvas Pop</a> to transform your bite-sized photo into a canvas sized masterpiece for $40.</p>
<h2>For the techie</h2>
<p>If you’re one of the cool kids you probably already own a 3-D printer, even though the process is still new and pricey to purchase a 3-D printer.</p>
<p>Using design software that is compatible with your 3-D printer, such as <a href="http://google-sketchup.en.softonic.com" target="_blank">Google Sketchup</a>, which is free, you can sketch a design and select the type of material (plastic, glass, metal) that you&#8217;d like to have produce your final product. Press print and watch as your printer makes your DIY gift right before your eyes. Printing time ranges from a few hours to a couple of minutes depending on the materials and dimension of your product.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/QnChn7vtWHU?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/QnChn7vtWHU?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Nylon chess sets, lamp shades and dream catchers can  be designed on a budget through <a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>, an online DIY marketplace. For those craving a more literal 3-D project, purchase a glass shadow box from <a href="http://www.goodwill.org" target="_blank">Goodwill</a>. Gather standout trinkets (pressed leaves, coins) from that mementos box you&#8217;ve been hiding in your closet. Collage and glue them to patterned paper. Mount the paper inside of the shadow box to create a striking 3-D image.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/102813-Pennywise-HolidaysBudget.jpg" alt="102813-Pennywise-HolidaysBudget" width="600" height="367" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-311" /><br />
The holidays offer a chance to enjoy the company of friends and family members and soak up the wonders of the season. Failing to keep a handle on spending, though, and holiday entertainment costs can quickly add up. Avoid running out of money before you’ve even tackled your gift list by approaching holiday celebrations with a savings mindset.</p>
<p>Gift yourself with savings this holiday season by trying these fun and inexpensive holiday celebration ideas.</p>
<h2>Get crafty</h2>
<p>Handmade decorations are in, and making your own can save a lot of money, says interior designer RoxAnn Johnson, owner of Spatial Expressions in Orange, Calif. She crotchets holiday decorations from free patterns she picks up at her local yarn store, and she enjoys creating inexpensive ornaments with repurposed items like old jewelry.</p>
<p>“I get Styrofoam balls from the craft store and take apart jewelry that I’m no longer wearing and attach it to the balls,” she says. “I also use old earrings to create garland. The ornaments and garland are fun projects to do with kids, and you end up creating family heirlooms.”</p>
<p>If you need more ideas, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=christmas%20decorations" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> can provide you with thousands of craft projects. </p>
<h2>Volunteer</h2>
<p>Celebrate the reason for the season and reach out to help those in need. Check with charitable organizations in your area to see about preparing and serving meals for the less fortunate. You could also visit and read to those in nursing homes or the hospital. Volunteering will get you and your family in the Christmas spirit, and such actions promise to teach your children compassion and important life lessons. To find volunteer opportunities, call your local newspaper to find out when it prints volunteer opportunities and organizations. Also, there are a lot of websites to connect you to the organization of your choice, such as <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org" target="_blank">VolunteerMatch.org</a> and <a href="http://www.voa.org/" target="_blank">Volunteers of America</a>. </p>
<h2>Throw a baking party</h2>
<p>Get ready for the holiday feasts ahead and spend time with friends and family members by hosting a baking party. Banding together to cook up Thanksgiving and Christmas Day homemade side dishes and freezing them for future use saves money, because you share the cost. Being prepared will also prevent you from making costly last-minute food purchases when it’s time to gather for holiday meals.</p>
<p>Also fun for children and adults is a cookie decorating party. Have everyone bring dough, cookie cutters and toppings, and let the festivities begin. For a small investment, you’ll create happy memories and yummy holiday treats.</p>
<h2>Go caroling</h2>
<p>Bring out the performer in yourself and your family by spreading holiday cheer and singing carols. Provide everyone with printed Christmas carol favorites and impress your neighbors with some snappy holiday tunes. When you’re done, gather by the fire to share hot apple cider and cast your votes for the best decorated yards in town.</p>
<h2>Limit alcoholic drinks</h2>
<p>Alcohol can be an enormous expense, and over-serving causes liability issues. Set an alcohol budget and stick to it. For instance, figure on two or three drinks per person and only buy that much wine or beer. Or cut expenses by just serving one holiday drink, such as eggnog. If you think that guests will want more than you’ll be providing, let them know what they can expect and suggest they bring their own to supplement, if they choose.</p>
<h2>Hold a holiday classic movie marathon</h2>
<p>Get family members and friends involved in creating your own list of top holiday classic movies. If you need inspiration, start with <a href="http://movies.amctv.com/movie-guide/christmas-movies/" target="_blank">AMC&#8217;s movie guide</a>. Once the list has been culled down, invite everyone to come over whenever they can during a weekend day to enjoy a movie or two. For admission, ask that they bring tasty snacks, such as popcorn or candy. And if the holiday season is making you feel especially generous, offer to let adults leave their children with you while they do a little shopping. This could save you even more money by serving as your “present” to them for the holidays.</p>
<p>Sure the holidays bring out the urge to splurge in all of us, and it’s easy to overspend. But with a little ingenuity and by focusing on building relationships, you can save a great deal of money this season and have some fun at the same time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-315" alt="111113-PushPenny-ColdWeatherRoutine1" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/111113-PushPenny-ColdWeatherRoutine1.jpg" width="600" height="455" />Do you change your skin care routine when the seasons change?</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re like most women, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; says <a href="https://twitter.com/jlofnp" target="_blank">Jodi LoGerfo</a>, dermatological nurse-practitioner for <a href="http://www.orentreich.com" target="_blank">Orentreich Medical Group</a> in New York City. &#8220;But you should switch up your skin care routine to adapt for (your) skin&#8217;s reaction to the colder temperature, wind and drying indoor heat,&#8221; she advises.</p>
<p>This is especially true if you live in the North and face more extreme cold, windy or wet weather or a combination of all three. Also, if you are on an anti-aging or an anti-acne prescription regimen and are using a Retin-A (tretinoin) product or an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) lotion or a combination of the two, you may need to make some changes because these products have side effects of dryness and irritation that will only be exacerbated by any cold or extreme winter weather.</p>
<h2>Re-evaluate your skincare routine for winter</h2>
<p><strong>Reduce use of Retin-A products.</strong> LoGerfo says you can cut your usage frequency of your prescription and it will continue to regenerate skin cell turn-over and form new collagen but without the drastic side effects of dryness, irritation and cracking that can increase in response to winter weather. Maximum Retin-A use is twice per day (morning and night), but if skin looks or feels irritated, try applying the product just once per day, every other day or even two or three times a week. You can experiment with how often and when to use it (such as morning versus night time if only once per day) so it doesn&#8217;t cause the irritating effects. The same goes for over-the-counter anti-aging products containing Retinol, which is also a vitamin A derivative just like Retin-A, but at a much lower concentration. Retinol products have a much less aggressive positive or negative effect on the skin, but you can adjust your usage the same way if necessary, LoGerfo advises.</p>
<p><strong>Switch alpha hydroxy acid lotion for a protective, emollient lotion.</strong> &#8220;Many times we prescribe an anti-aging regimen combining the use of a Retin-A product and an alpha hydroxy acid product for the best effect. But, during the winter, you can stop using your alpha hydroxyl acid product if skin seems irritated,&#8221; LoGerfo suggests. Instead, she recommends using a thick cream facial moisturizer over any Retin-A to protect against cracking, peeling and chapping.</p>
<p><strong>No more long, hot showers.</strong> Hot water is very irritating and drying to your skin&#8217;s top-most layer, especially if it is already irritated by other products, indoor dry heat, winter wind and cold temperatures. The hot water strips skin it of its natural oils leaving it unprotected and open to cracking and peeling. LoGerfo advises taking quicker, lukewarm showers, for less than 10 minutes at a time, and to pat skin dry gently (no harsh rubbing on skin or hair). While your skin is still damp, apply a super-rich cream moisturizer for hands, feet and anywhere else you see drying or cracked skin. Even better, try adding <a href="http://pushpenny.com/blog/2013/10/22/virgin-coconut-oil-11-ways-to-eat-it-and-wear-it/" target="_blank">virgin coconut oil</a> to your skin care routine to help it retain moisture and resist cracking and irritation.</p>
<p><strong>Use a humidifier.</strong> Indoor heat can be very drying to your skin. &#8220;You&#8217;ll know if this is the case in your home if your nasal passages also feel dry,&#8221; LoGerfo says. Try a room humidifier all night and even all day to help skin and nasal passages remain moist, the way they should be.</p>
<h2>And the one thing you should never change…</h2>
<p><strong>Don’t ever go without your sunscreen.</strong> Just because it&#8217;s winter doesn’t mean the sun is not strong. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen some of the most severe sunburns on people doing winter sports such as skiing or ice skating outdoors because snow and ice reflects sunlight in combination with wind burn,&#8221; LoGerfo says. &#8220;Because your exposed skin (face, neck and hands) is always vulnerable to continuing damage from the sun&#8217;s UV rays whether winter or summer, I always recommend using a daily SPF of at least 30 whenever going outside. And don&#8217;t forget your lips.&#8221;</p>
<p>How will you tune-up your skincare routine for the winter?</p>

<p>From avant-garde statement pieces to delicate classics, celebrities, runway mavens and fashionistas alike are clamoring for costume jewelry. Mega moguls such <a href="https://twitter.com/Oprah" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227/" target="_blank">Sienna Miller</a> praise designer <a href="http://www.liasophia.com/regional/home" target="_blank">Lia Sophia</a>, while singers like <a href="https://twitter.com/Beyonce" target="_blank">Beyonce</a> are adorned in the latest <a href="http://www.melodyehsani.com" target="_blank">Melody Ehsani</a> pieces. With these jewels ranging from $16-$125, it’s only natural that celeb sitings would sound a fashion alarm. Hooray for a trend that is finally accessible to the masses!</p>
<div id="attachment_329" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-329" alt="For more examples of Arizaga's work, see her blog" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Arizaga1-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">For more examples of Arizaga&#8217;s work, see her <a href="http://venessaarizaga.com/blog">blog</a>.</p></div>
<p>Emerging leaders of the pack understand why working women, both on-screen and off, are flocking to this trend. Designer Amber Mims of the Washington D.C. line <a href="http://2322designs.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">‘2322,’</a> explains, “The phrase ‘costume jewelry’ implies dressing up, playing a character or taking a risk. I believe it’s meant for us to use as tool to learn something new about ourselves.”</p>
<p>Whether outfitting your alter ego or spicing up a corporate look, today’s hottest styles won’t be found in your mother’s jewelry box. Void of glue-gunned rhinestones, this new crop of eclectic jewelers, find inspiration in nature.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-333" alt="Mims2" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mims2-195x300.jpg" width="195" height="300" />“The materials are recyclables; from bottle caps &amp; wine corks to scrap fabric and door stoppers.” says Mims. Artist <a href="http://www.bariziperstein.com" target="_blank">Bari Ziperstein</a> creates rings and breastplate necklaces out of clay by “reusing extra bits of my sculptures.” All elements of her line, <a href="http://www.bzippyandcompany.com" target="_blank">B. Zippy &amp; Co</a>, are handcrafted. “Nothing is store bought. They’re sculptural statements. It’s a constant balance of that interpretation … the bits and parts make up a larger narrative,” she says.</p>
<p>Made “for women with strong characters … who aren’t afraid to make a statement,” the <a href="http://venessaarizaga.com" target="_blank">Venessa Arizaga</a> collection was inspired by the designer’s 2007 trip to Puerto Rico. She reveals, “(I) was inspired by the beauty of the beaches and the relaxed island culture, so I spontaneously started making jewelry from seashells and stones that I picked up. I started using mixed media to create my pieces. I wanted each one to have a different story.”</p>
<p>Working as a design director for <a href="http://www.zacposen.com" target="_blank">Zac Posen</a> at the time, she conceptualized humorous themes to bring her witty yet elegant line to life. “Accessories should be fun and should make the wearer feel happy. I believe our pieces do exactly that. We did a Junk Food collection, a Vices collection, and just recently we were inspired by tropical beaches all over the world.” Arizaga’s bracelets, starting at $55, are now <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/sr?origin=keywordsearch&amp;contextualcategoryid=2375500&amp;keyword=Venessa+Arizaga" target="_blank">sold by Nordstrom</a> and favored by actresses <a href="https://twitter.com/itsmeleighton" target="_blank">Leighton Meester</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/selenagomez" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>.</p>
<p>With costume becoming the new norm, what’s the secret to maintaining flawless baubles? <a href="http://www.shopbich.com" target="_blank">Ritch Bich</a>, a Los Angeles boutique carrying wallet friendly, pretty little things, has the answer. Its best-sellers include hot-to-trot earrings that fly off of the shelves at $14 and toprings (which sit between your knuckle and fingernail) for less than $20.</p>
<p>“People who haven&#8217;t bought costume or fashion jewelry in awhile might be surprised by the quality,” says co-owner Amorette Brooms. “This not Claire&#8217;s. We carry costume jewels for grown-ups. This is affordable merchandise, however, there are certain rules.”</p>
<p>To get the most wear out of your playful pieces, Brooms suggests steering clear of water, removing jewelry before applying lotion and perfume, and tucking away your goods once the party’s over. “The most important rule is to store your jewels in Ziploc bags. Air is what causes the oxidation or &#8220;turning&#8221; of metals,” she says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-305" alt="110613-PushPenny-IdentityTheftTips" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/110613-PushPenny-IdentityTheftTips-e1384274115771.jpg" style="width:600px;height:365px;"/>Three men distracted a Nordstrom cashier in Aventura, Fla., to case the cash register, according to news reports. Later, three different men again distracted cashiers, tampered with and installed &#8220;skimming&#8221; devices to six cash registers to intercept credit and debit card data. The devices were discovered by Nordstrom surveillance footage and removed before the thieves could recover the devices and use the stolen data to fraudulently clone credit cards.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one kind of identity fraud you could encounter while shopping this holiday season, says Miranda Perry of <a href="Scambook.com" target="_blank">Scambook.com</a>, a free scam complaint and resolution company.</p>
<p>The definition of identity fraud is any unauthorized use of personal information for financial gain such as making fraudulent purchases on a stolen credit card, taking control of existing accounts or opening new accounts, including mobile phone or utility services.</p>
<p>In honor of International Fraud Awareness Week, Nov. 3-9, we want help you be extra-vigilant this holiday season.</p>
<p>Identity fraud incidents in 2012 increased by more than 1 million victims and the dollar amount stolen increased to $21 billion, according to The Javelin Strategy &amp; Research 2013 Identity Fraud Report. The report counts 12.6 million victims of identity fraud in the United States last year. That&#8217;s one victim every 3 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>One bright spot:</strong> Because more than 50 percent of victims were actively detecting fraud using financial alerts, credit monitoring or identity protection services and by monitoring their own accounts, the amount of time financial information is being misused is growing shorter. In 2012, crooks had an average of 48 days to raid your accounts, down from 55 days in 2011.</p>
<p>While you have no control over what the scammers are doing to get at your personal information, you do have the steps you take to protect yourself from identity theft.</p>
<h2>Sign up for credit monitoring</h2>
<p>Many services you may already pay for  provide credit monitoring. Call your credit card companies and bank to find out what type of fraud detection they provide. If you are a member of AAA in Southern California, Texas, Hawaii, and New Mexico, make sure you sign up to receive free daily monitoring of your Experian credit report.</p>
<p>There are also companies you can pay to monitor your information, such as <a href="http://www.lifelock.com/" target="_blank">LifeLock</a>, which pledges to spend up to $1 million to recover your stolen funds if you become a victim of identity theft. Plans range from $110-$275 a year.</p>
<h2>Protect your passwords; shop securely</h2>
<div>According to a 2012 <a href="CreditDonkey.com" target="_blank">CreditDonkey.com</a> survey, more than three in 10 people share passwords with a friend and 68 percent of consumers use the same password for multiple websites. Don&#8217;t be a target; online burglars can do a lot of damage with one password. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises never sharing your passwords with anyone and never using the same passwords for multiple websites, especially for email and bank accounts.</div>
<div>
<p>Be sure you are shopping securely before entering any payment, passwords or personal information, whether on a PC or on a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone, especially when using typically unsecure public Wi-Fi at the airport or a coffee shop. According to Javelin<strong>, </strong>a secure connection is usually denoted by “https” (not just &#8220;http&#8221;) at the start of the merchant’s web address or a bright green box and padlock in the browser address bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;These can be faked and scammers are lurking on unsecure networks, so we advise limiting shopping and financial transactions to a secure network, such as your home network,&#8221; Perry says. In addition, she recommends turning off the automatic Wi-Fi connection setting on your smart phone so you are never unknowingly connected to an unsecure network.</p>
</div>
<h2>Use credit instead of debit</h2>
<p>Credit cards companies actively track fraudulent behavior on consumer accounts and limit liability for fraudulent purchases, while debit cards (which are dangerously connected directly to your bank account) typically do not, explains Perry. Alternatively, she says, you can purchase prepaid gift or credit card for each shopping trip and prevent thieves from accessing your financial information. Practicing this safe and secure payment option will also help you stay on budget.</p>
<h2>Watch out for gift card scams</h2>
<p>The holiday season is a huge time for gift card purchases, and gift card scammers, Perry says.</p>
<p>Never purchase gift cards from sellers on websites such as craigslist or Ebay. Buy them from authorized retailers or large, reputable websites that are well-known, Perry says. &#8220;In-store, be sure to inspect packaging, and if the bar code or any part of the packaging or card is bent it could have been tampered with by scammers.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Create a smart phone password</h2>
<p>A lot of identity theft still happens the old fashioned way: Theft of personal items such as backpacks, purses and wallets containing your account numbers, credit cards and smart phone.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reports that mobile security threats have increased more than 350 percent since 2010. Perry stresses that everyone should password-protect his or her cell phone in case of theft to avoid illicit access to any of your stored personal information including passwords, birth date, addresses, social security number, account numbers and card numbers thieves use to commit identity fraud. If you have a smart phone, there is a setting that will allow you to create a password to access your phone.</p>
<p>Save yourself from identity theft and install a password on your phone <strong>right now</strong>. According to a 2013 Consumer Reports survey, 61 percent of adult smartphone users have not!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Make Xerox copies of your debit and credit cards — front and back. That way if your wallet is stolen, you still have the account numbers and customer service phone numbers to call tucked away in a safe place.</p>

Could you prepare dinner for a family of four for $10 or less? Chef Alicia McCabe, director of Share Our Strength&#8217;s <a href="http://cookingmatters.org">Cooking Matters Massachusetts</a>, teaches shoppers how to do just that with a field trip to a grocery store.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org" target="_blank">Share Our Strength</a> is to end childhood hunger by helping low-income families across the country learn how to buy and prepare healthy and delicious low-cost meals. The benchmark of each dinner is to provide food for a family of four for $10 or less, using ingredients from at least three food groups. To accomplish its goal, it offers a program to adults and children called Cooking Matters that includes a grocery shopping tour.</p>
<p>During a recent trip to the store, McCabe shared some money-saving and food-shopping tips, which can help anyone spend less at the grocery store and pick up more nutritious items. If you’re already a pro at cutting back the grocery bill, these tips serve as good reminders.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cheaper isn’t always better: </b>In the produce aisle, a one-pound bag of organic carrots was cheaper than the same-size bag of regular carrots based on the unit prices; that’s not usually the case. Organic is typically more expensive than non-organic items. To get the best deal, zero in on the unit price. Baby carrots, which are regular carrots that have been milled and cut, cost the most, according to the unit pricing. Still, baby carrots are a nutritious snack. “They’re not a bad deal if that’s what your kids will eat,” McCabe says. “Buy what works for your family.”</li>
<li><b>Color matters:</b> For the most nutrition per your produce dollars, get the deepest colored vegetables you can find. Choose romaine lettuce or red leaf lettuce over iceberg. That’s a general rule. There’s still a place for iceberg, on BLT’s, for example. Just don’t make it your go-to lettuce.</li>
<li><b>Fresh isn’t always better</b>. Frozen green beans, for example, can be cheaper than the fresh varieties. But it depends on the season, so watch the unit prices to know when to buy fresh versus frozen and vice versa.</li>
<li><b>A frozen food bonus:</b> If you’ve got picky eaters, it’s easy to personalize a meal with frozen food. You could serve green beans to one child and corn to another by scooping up one serving from the freezer.</li>
<li><b>Load up on produce</b>: According to <a href="ChooseMyPlate.gov" target="_blank">ChooseMyPlate.gov</a>, half of your plate should be made up of fruits and veggies and are cheaper than meat. Produce is packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber, disease-fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals. Consider it an investment in everyone’s health future.</li>
<li><b>Buy products in larger-sized packages. </b>While strolling down the dairy section, McCabe says to not be limited by products. Instead of buying blueberry yogurt, for example, cut costs by purchasing a large container of plain yogurt and mixing in fresh or frozen blueberries. Use the rest of the yogurt in smoothies, as a topper for baked potatoes and in baked goods in place of sour cream, she says.</li>
<li><b>Learn more about the products:</b> McCabe points out that because of the popularity of Greek yogurt these days, it tends to be more expensive then plain yogurt. Greek yogurt is just regular yogurt that has been strained. This process concentrates the protein, which is why Greek yogurt typically offers more protein than regular yogurt, McCabe says. But some of the calcium and vitamin A escapes in the process. To save money, and for a protein punch with the calcium and vitamin A of regular yogurt, she suggests buying regular yogurt (at the lowest unit price) and adding your own nuts, such as pistachios, almonds, walnuts or cashews.</li>
<li><b>Experiment with store brands. </b>McCabe says to give store brands a try.<b> </b>In general, a supermarket’s store brand product is cheaper than a name-brand product even when paired with a coupon. Still, be picky. If the store-brand cereal, mayonnaise or ketchup (three products that garner the most name-brand loyalty) don’t measure up to the name brand, splurge on the name brand, preferably when it is on sale and with a coupon.</li>
<li><b>Don’t buy the “lite” version.</b> In the juice aisle, “lite” is code for “water.” Why pay a premium for a watery product when you can add water to the product yourself and pay less for it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget to plan a weekly menu. A game plan for food budgeting doesn’t have to be elaborate. For ideas on cheap eats you can whip up in your own kitchen, check out <a href="http://www.cookingmatters.org">CookingMatters.org</a>. Cooking Matters also has a free recipe app that has all of its chef-developed, healthy and affordable recipes. The app is available on iTunes and Google Play.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-282" alt="102113-Pennywise-EatingHealthy" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/102113-Pennywise-EatingHealthy.jpg" width="600" height="267" />You know the importance of feeding yourself and your family good-for-you foods, but noshing on meals and snacks made from ingredients such as free-range chicken, organic produce and whole grains can be a budget-buster. With a little planning and creativity, though, you can serve healthy meals without straining your budget.</p>
<p><b>1. Get organized</b></p>
<p>“It’s entirely possible to eat healthy on a budget, if you stay organized and map out your meals,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/susangweiner" target="_blank">Susan G. Weiner</a>, a registered dietitian-nutritionist in private practice in Long Island, NY, and author of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Diabetes-Organizer-Manageable/dp/1938170261" target="_blank">The Complete Diabetes Organizer</a>.”</p>
<p>“Keep a running inventory of items in your refrigerator, freezer and pantry, so you don’t waste food. And avoid buying excess, because even canned goods expire,” she says. “When you do freeze something or store it in the refrigerator, make sure that you label it (with a date), or you’ll end up wasting a lot of money by eventually throwing it out.”</p>
<p>Weiner also suggests creating a meal plan each week based on what you already have in your kitchen and any healthy food items that are on sale at your local grocery store.</p>
<p>“If broccoli and chicken breasts are on special, plan one or more meals using those food items, and include the tomato sauce you have in the pantry,” she says.</p>
<p><b>2. Use meat as a condiment</b></p>
<p>Offset the high cost of free-range and grass-fed cuts of meat by serving them in limited quantities. For instance, use a whole organic chicken to make chicken broth, stir-fry and a pasta dish. A hormone-free beef roast can be used to make a stew, casserole and shepherd’s pie.</p>
<p>When you do buy meat as the main course, make it affordable by following the advice of nutrition experts and purchasing small, lean cuts.</p>
<p><b>3. Highlight cheap protein</b></p>
<p>A wide variety of inexpensive protein sources besides meats can be used to create healthy meals for just pennies a serving. Build meals around foods such as beans, lentils and legumes, tofu and high-protein grains such as quinoa, which is a complete protein. An internet search for recipes involving these foods will produce many tasty options.</p>
<p><b>4. Choose generic and store brands</b></p>
<p>Foods don’t need a high-profile brand name to be wholesome and nutritious. Generic and store brand versions of products such as rice, pasta, grains, yogurt, cottage cheese, beans and cheese cost 30 to 50 percent less on average.</p>
<p><b>5. Try slow cooking</b></p>
<p>Cooking with a Crock-Pot can save you money in more ways than one. The long process of slow cooking tenderizes less expensive, tough cuts of meat, such as chuck steak or roasts, beef brisket and pork shoulder. Combine a low-price piece of meat with inexpensive root veggies such as potatoes, carrots and onions or rice, and you can serve up mouthwatering meals for very little money. A slow cooker also uses less energy to power than an oven or stovetop, saving on your utility bill as well.</p>
<p><b>6. Grow your own fruits and vegetables</b></p>
<p>Growing and harvesting your own produce can save a substantial amount of money. According to the <a href="http://www.garden.org" target="_blank">National Gardening Association</a>, gardens produce an average of half a pound of vegetables per square foot of garden space, and established fruit trees can produce 50 pounds of fruit in one season.</p>
<p>When you harvest an excess of produce or find fruit and veggies on sale in the market, use every means possible to preserve them. Good options include drying, freezing and canning. Some vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, peaches and plums, can also be blanched and frozen for future use.</p>
<p>Eating healthy on a budget does take some planning, but the results of dining on good-for-you foods and saving money in the process is worth the effort.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-274" alt="102113-Pennywyse-MAP" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywyse-MAP-e1384273404439.jpg"/><br />
“Is that best price you can offer me?” Have you ever tried this bargaining tactic outside of a car dealership? Major retailers, such as <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/b/webapp/catalog/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1" target="_blank">The Home Depot</a>, might be able to offer you a price lower than the advertised price.</p>
<p>When you shop online or scan your newspaper circular for sales, you’ll notice that many products, such as a 50” Sony TV, for example, are the same price no matter where they’re sold. That’s Minimum Advertised Price, or MAP, at work.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission oversees the legality of MAP policies. MAP is an agreement between suppliers and retailers stipulating the lowest price a product can be advertised at, whether it is on a billboard, a website or a magazine ad. Retailers can incur sizeable fines and/or penalties from their suppliers for violating a MAP contract. Suppliers might also cease doing business with MAP violators. MAP policies can also stipulate how a product is sold. If a manufacturer wants to only do business with small, local retailers, for example, a retailer who advertises the manufacturer’s product to consumers on Amazon.com would be violating the manufacturer’s MAP policy.</p>
<p>But MAP sets the <i>advertised</i> price. If you go into a store, you could buy something below MAP by simply asking for a better deal.</p>
<p>“Retailers can’t advertise a price to the public that’s below MAP,” says <a href="https://www.greentoe.com/aboutus" target="_blank">Joe Marrapodi</a>. He is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="Greentoe.com" target="_blank">Greentoe.com</a>, a site that allows consumers to negotiate with retailers online instead of haggling face to face on the prices of products in five categories: baby products, photography, home theater, appliances and music. MAP protects manufacturers and restricts retailers from undercutting the competition to register higher sales. It also allows manufacturers to control, to some extent, how retailers handle their products. However, retailers are allowed to sell products below MAP.</p>
<p>“They have the flexibility of going lower than MAP if they’re dealing one on one,” Marrapodi says. That’s why it pays to ask if there’s any room in the deal. In other words, the price you pay for a product can go below the MAP-required advertised price without anybody getting in trouble.</p>
<h2>Sidestepping MAP</h2>
<p>In addition to direct negotiations, there are other ways retailers can give you a better deal without violating MAP policies with their suppliers. According to the <a href="http://www.sba.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>, online retailers might offer free shipping or coupon codes. Although both maneuvers affect the price of the product, neither reduces the advertised dollar value of the MAP-protected product.</p>
<p>How much of a price reduction should you try to get? MAP policies can differ among retailers and suppliers. One strategy is to pick a major retailer, such as <a href="Amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, and print out the price its advertising for the product you want. Take that print out to a local business to see if it will match Amazon’s advertised price. That’s a tactic Marrapodi used to buy a new refrigerator at The Home Depot, which shaved about 20 percent off the price.</p>
<p>Even major retailers you’d never think would be willing to negotiate, such as <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com" target="_blank">Nordstrom</a>, have pricing wiggle room, especially if you’re buying more than one item, Marrapodi says. All it takes is the courage to ask for a better price.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to know that MAP is an undercurrent in the retail world, isn’t it? Aside from garage sales, where haggling is expected, have you ever tried asking for a better price at a retail store? What was your experience? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-263" alt="102113-Pennywyse-ShopSmartForFall" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywyse-ShopSmartForFall.jpg" width="600" height="275" /><br />
Dressing the part doesn’t always have to equate to having deep pockets like Daddy Warbucks. A savvy shopper knows how to look the part for less. With fall in full swing and the holidays knocking, Pennywyse asked style experts to weigh in on shopping smarter.</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 1</strong><br />
<em>Pump your breaks before hitting the retail circuit</em>. Before convincing yourself that you have nothing to wear, access your wardrobe. “Do a closet edit first and see what&#8217;s missing from your wardrobe,” says <a href="http://www.eamgmt.com/styling" target="_blank">Dana Goldberg</a>, wardrobe stylist for Louis Vuitton and Bravo. Taking an inventory will help you determine what to keep, donate or repurpose.</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 2</strong><br />
<em>Invest in staples.</em> Opt for pieces that can transition through multiple seasons. Make a list of your personal must-haves. <a href="http://www.eamgmt.com/brunolima" target="_blank">Bruno Lima</a>, stylist to comedienne Amy Sedaris, tells shoppers to: “Spend money on a good new pair of shoes. They will last forever and everyone will notice!” <a href="http://rebeccabrie.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Rebecca Brie</a>, who helps many stars glam up for the Grammys adds, “Be sure to have a classic white button up shirt and lightweight scarves in bold prints.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 3</strong><br />
<em>Take advantage of online sales and coupons.</em> <a href="http://www.instagram.com/luckysmyler" target="_blank">Lucky Smyler</a>, a makeup artist for stars such as ABC’s &#8221;<a href="http://www.hulu.com/scandal" target="_blank">Scandal</a>&#8220; star <a href="http://www.kerrywashington.com" target="_blank">Kerry Washington</a>, won’t buy a product unless he’s searched online for the coupon code. “Check the sale icon. You can find high quality stuff for less than half price. I recently got <a href="http://www.stilacosmetics.com" target="_blank">Stila</a> eye shadow kits, which retail at $45, for $6!”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 4</strong><br />
<em>Look beyond the women’s department.</em> British singer-songwriter and actress Rita Ora’s stylist, <a href="http://www.jasonrembert.com" target="_blank">Jason Rembert</a>, challenges women to lift the veil. “Venture to men’s and find things that work. Belt it, have fun with it! Find a tailor or young designer in your neighborhood. Get the look you want for $200 as opposed to $1,000.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 5</strong><br />
<em>Don&#8217;t be afraid to try before you buy. </em>Smyler encourages women to even try on makeup before making a large purchase. “Write everything down and tell them that you need to wear it for the day,” he says. “Get the sales associate’s name and come back. You don’t know how your face may react or oxidize.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 6</strong><br />
<em>Splurge on fall accessories. </em>Lima says they&#8217;re “…the cheapest way to update your look. Don’t invest a huge amount on an item that has a seasonal color and will soon be dated.” Rembert suggests surfing discount retailers. “Buy a $10 pashmina scarf on the street. On-trend tribal jewelry can be stacked from <a href="http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21" target="_blank">Forever 21</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 7</strong><br />
<em>Scope out the sales associates.</em> “I started in retail before I became a celebrity makeup artist,” Smyler says. “Always observe the way the salesperson does her makeup. If it looks questionable, don’t ask for advice.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 8</strong><br />
<em>Search for helpful apps. </em>Brie, who posts fashion trends on her Tumblr blog, is very tech-savvy. “I’m a big fan of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poshmark/id470412147" target="_blank">Poshmark</a>, an iPhone app that allows women to shop (for) and sell interesting pieces. It’s sort of like eBay, but way cooler because it’s strictly women&#8217;s clothes and a community of some really fashionable women,” she says. “If you love a certain brand, register with their site so that you can receive alerts about all of their sales before the public.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 9</strong><br />
<em>Don’t be a billboard.</em> Goldberg warns to stay away from a trend if it doesn’t suit your body type. “You can wear comfortable, timeless pieces, and stay on trend, if you accessorize well. I love the embellished booties from <a href="http://www.chloe.com/#/en" target="_blank">Chloe</a> last season, but <a href="http://schutz-shoes.com" target="_blank">Shutz</a> has a great pair at a much lower price point. Throw on a cute leather bag across the shoulder and a fun fall hat and you&#8217;re good to go.”</p>
<p><strong>Rule No. 10</strong><br />
<em>Recreate new pieces from your closet</em>. “Pants with holes? Take them to the dry-cleaners. Patch them up and make them your own,” Rembert says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-253" alt="102813-PushPenny-HolidayTravel" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102813-PushPenny-HolidayTravel.jpg" width="600" height="323" /></p>
<p>Traveling over the holidays this year? Then you need to know the best way to get the best deal possible on your airfare.</p>
<p>Some say the best time to purchase a ticket is 6 weeks before your trip, others say 21 days before your departure and some suggest you should travel on the holiday itself to save money. So, which is it?</p>
<h2>Timing is everything</h2>
<p>&#8220;There is actually no magic time or date to book holiday airfares because they now change so rapidly and so often,&#8221; says <a href="https://twitter.com/airfarewatchdog" target="_blank">George Hobica</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com" target="_blank">airfarewatchdog.com</a>. The website is an expert source of airline deals and the information is researched and verified by a team of airfare industry insiders. &#8220;Fares can change daily, weekly and monthly. That&#8217;s because the number of seats available in the lowest fare class fluctuates as consumers give up held but (not purchased) seats or because the airlines adjust the number of seats available in the lowest fare class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hobica recommends you sign up for airfare search alerts as soon as you know your exact travel dates. You can elect to have alerts emailed to your inbox on a daily or weekly basis or when a flight reaches a drops below a certain price.</p>
<p>Even better, Hobica advises using the flexible date option whenever possible on airline or flight search websites, such as <a href="http://www.kayak.com" target="_blank">Kayak</a> or <a href="http://www.orbitz.com" target="_blank">Orbitz</a>. If you don&#8217;t have to travel on specific dates, this tool takes into account cheaper fares on days before and after your planned travel dates and sometimes even on the holiday itself, which can result in sizable savings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set up alerts as soon as possible. Then search several sites, in different ways, many times a day until that lower fare choice pops out at you. Then book it fast.&#8221; Hobica advises.</p>
<p>You might also try searching for two one-way tickets, either from the same airline or one airline for departure and a different airline for return to see which is cheapest. You can also check with the <a href="http://www.bing.com/travel" target="_blank">Bing airfare price predictor</a>, which tracks past fares to see if you should buy now or wait for a better price.</p>
<h2>Watch out for add-on fees</h2>
<p>In an effort to reduce ticket prices and remain competitive, many airlines have switched to an à la carte menu of fees. Every service outside the seat fare has a specific price, such as baggage fees, extra room fees, early boarding fees as well as change flight fees, among many others. Budget airlines, such as Frontier, even charge drink fees for any option except water.</p>
<p>When you are considering which airline or type of ticket to book, be aware that airline luggage fees for checked bags and sometimes even carry-on fees are tacked on to the ticket prices and must be accounted for in your travel budget.</p>
<p>One of the most extreme examples of this is Spirit Air. While the airfare may seem inexpensive, know that Spirit charges $25 to $100 for a carry-on bag and another $20 to $100 depending on whether you list the bag during the booking process or show up with it at the gate, which could add a substantial amount to your total ticket price, especially if your are traveling with family members.</p>
<p>Some airlines, such as American Airlines, recently announced a new pricing structure that offers bundled packages for fees. For $68, you can check one bag each way and have the option to change your travel dates without a change fee. Hobica says changing your travel dates can cost $100 or more, plus the difference in fares.</p>
<p>“It can be more consumer-friendly with the fee bundle if you would (normally) pay $50 to check your bag anyway and if you often run in to the problem of changing your tickets. Then you can really save some money for only $18 more,” Hobica says.</p>
<p>But if you stick to your travel plans and pack light, no fees is the way to go with airlines such as JetBlue or Southwest, if the airfare is right.</p>

<p>If you’re gearing up for a new baby, now is a great time to get in on some of the best deals of the year.</p>
<p>Baby gear is big business in the U.S., generating $6 billion in online sales alone, according to IBIS World, a leading market research firm. The annual <a href="http://www.theabcshow.com" target="_blank">All Baby &amp; Kids trade show</a> for the baby products industry just wrapped up earlier this month at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It drew more than 10,000 attendees from 66 countries. Nearly 3,000 booths displayed baby gear and products, from strollers, high chairs and car seats, to cribs, play yards and bottles, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Retailers and e-tailers will be clearing out current inventory to make room for the 2014 products, which start arriving in stores and debuting on websites between November and January. What does that mean for you, the consumer? <strong>Sales!</strong></p>
<p>Watch for baby products to go on sale before and after the holidays. Check your local newspaper circulars and sign up to receive newsletters and discounts from your favorite baby-gear stores on their websites. Check the baby gear sales sections of websites such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_4?rh=n%3A165796011%2Cn%3A166828011%2Ck%3ABaby+gear&amp;keywords=Baby+gear&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383000894&amp;rnid=165797011" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, then compare that price with other prices you can find on the web. “Like” favorite brands and retailers on Facebook, follow them on Twitter and sign up for a manufacturer’s newsletter or online club for parents, too — three more ways to get insider info.</p>
<p>Chicco (pronounced kee-ko), an Italian manufacturer of stylish and high-quality car seats, strollers and other children’s products, offers the Chicco Club on its <a href="www.chiccousa.com" target="_blank">corporate website</a>. Members who join the club by signing up with an e-mail address can take advantage of contests, giveaways and special promotions on Chicco products, such as receiving a free Chicco KeyFit car seat base when you purchase a Chicco Cortina travel system, or receiving an extra Playard mattress when you purchase a Chicco Lullaby Playard between specified dates.</p>
<p>With the good deals offered this time of year, you might be buying last year’s model. But some baby products, such as strollers, don’t change that much from one year to the next except for a refresh on the “fashions,” which is baby-gear lingo for fabrics and colors. Last year’s colors will seem new to you anyway if you are a new parent, unless you happen to be a repeat customer.</p>
<p>Manufacturers often offer multiple ways to save. To give you an idea on the amount you can save, check out the relatively new <a href="www.chiccoshop.com" target="_blank">Chicco shopping website</a>.</p>
<p>At the All Baby &amp; Kids show, representatives said the site was the place to go for replacement stroller parts, not good deals. But with a little bit of time spent on the site, you can find the <a href="http://www.chiccoshop.com/gear/travel-systems/cortina-keyfit-30-travel-system---martini/07060796560070.html#q=Cortina+Keyfit30+Travel+System&amp;selected=bcqVMiaagY7boaaac9IbkcGmtE&amp;start=1" target="_blank">Cortina Keyfit30 Travel System</a>, a stroller and an infant car seat that attach, for $329.99 — the same price it’s listed for on Amazon. But upon paying for products on <a href="Chiccoshop.com" target="_blank">Chiccoshop.com</a>, it offers $100 off the retail price. And if you sign up with your e-mail address, you’ll receive free shipping if you spend at least $50.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chicco is trying to (quietly) move its Cortina Keyfit30 Travel System and other 2013 products — and slashing $100 off the purchase price is certainly a way to do it, don’t you agree?</p>
<p>So get in on the baby gear sales bonanza by keeping your eyes peeled for great deals like these between now and early January.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-234" alt="102113-Pennywyse-SmartShopping" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywyse-SmartShopping.jpg" width="600" height="360" />Whether its hamburger buns, a pair of boots or an HDTV, do you have a price in mind when you set out for a shopping trip? Recent research found that most people do, even though you should look at more than just the price to get the best deal for your money.</p>
<p>Retailers know you are focused on the price and try to entice you into the store with appealing advertisements. Many shoppers remain price-fixated and end up spending more instead of comparative shopping while inside the store.</p>
<h2>The science of price fixation</h2>
<p>Two marketing professors from Brigham Young University and Emory University tested this theory and reported their results in 2012 in <i>Journal of Marketing Research</i>.</p>
<p>They used different types of products, including televisions, pens, laptops, ear buds, garage doors, mattresses, Blu-ray players and luggage. They asked consumers taking part in the study to approach the price in different ways, such as naming a target price, naming a maximum price, choosing a price from a set of choices or determining a budget for a specific purchase.</p>
<p>The result was always the same no matter which product was being considered for purchase. No matter how consumers determined a price, they spent up to 50 percent more when they started shopping with a price in mind than those who didn’t.</p>
<p>&#8220;After we screen our choices based on price, we essentially ignore price after that and focus on quality, noticing all the higher-quality choices,&#8221; explains the study’s co-author Jeffrey Larson, assistant professor of marketing at BYU’s Marriott School of Management, in his research. &#8220;Better quality products usually cost more, enticing us to spend more.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Pay attention to features, quality and size</h2>
<p>When setting a price limit for an item, you have essentially ignored all the possibly lower-priced options that have all of the features and benefits you wanted.</p>
<p>Not only are you probably paying more by focusing solely on the price, but what’s more surprising is you may not looking as carefully at what you are buying because your price was satisfied, says Britt Beemer, who conducted a survey about price satisfaction in the 2011 Consumer Track Back-To-School Shopping Survey.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study found that more than half of people shopping base their decision solely on price and don&#8217;t notice how an item is made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You can miss out on even more than quality, too, says James Dion, president of Dionco, a Chicago-based retail consulting firm. &#8220;Even with smaller-ticket items, such as food packages, footwear, apparel and household goods, you may overlook a smaller item or package size, a set with fewer items and low-quality ingredients or cheaply-made goods at that lower acceptable price-point you have pre-determined.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Compare prices last</h2>
<ul>
<li>Focus on features and quality first, especially for big-ticket items such as TVs and smartphones, and then focus on the price of products that has the qualities you want.</li>
<li>Pay attention to how many pieces are part of each product before focusing on the price to be sure you are getting what you need and how much you are willing to pay. For example: Does the bed set include a skirt with the bedding? How many buns are in that bag of hot dog buns for the cheapest price versus the price you are willing to pay? Count and check before you buy.</li>
<li>Look carefully at the quality of an item, especially for footwear and apparel. Notice how attachments are affixed to the product, the tightness of the stitching, the quality of fabrication and number of embellishments before focusing on the price.</li>
</ul>
<p>This smarter way of shopping will get you exactly what you need and want at a price that just might be less than you had in mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywise-HomeRepairs.jpg" alt="102113-Pennywise-HomeRepairs" width="600" height="397" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-214" /><br />
Your home is your castle; that safe haven where you can pull up the drawbridge, relax with family and friends and take a break from the outside world. But did you know that your retreat may also harbor costly and even dangerous trouble?  </p>
<p>Ignoring or failing to notice warning signs, such as leaning trees or a clogged dryer vent, can lead to injuries and expensive repair bills.</p>
<p>Save money, preserve the health of your home and set your mind at ease by checking the following danger zones on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>1. Roof</h2>
<p>As your home’s first line of defense against the outdoor elements, your roof gets hit hard, and the slightest problem can quickly become a costly disaster. </p>
<p>Visually inspect your roof at the change of every season, checking for loose, broken or missing roof tiles or shingles, which should be replaced as soon as possible. Also, clear your gutters of leaves and debris so that they can flow freely. Make sure that the downspouts emit water away from the foundation. </p>
<h2>2. HVAC System</h2>
<p>Replacing the filter on your heating and cooling system is an easy preventative measure that can save you thousands of dollars in costly repairs and prevent potentially deadly fires. If a filter becomes clogged with dust and debris, the system works harder and less effectively, potentially burning out the engine. In rare instances, the heating system can catch on fire.</p>
<h2>3. Landscape</h2>
<p>Plants surrounding your home that are unstable, such as trees and large bushes, create various hazards. Unsteady vegetation or loose limbs can fall on your roof or siding, and plants with an invasive root system can damage the foundation. Stabilize or remove any vegetation that is unsteady or invasive. Also have trees trimmed by 15 to 20 percent in the fall, so that wind flows through them.</p>
<h2>4. Laundry room</h2>
<p>Malfunctioning of your dryer can result in costly repairs, and some dryer accidents can be life threatening.  According to the U.S. Fire Administration, roughly 2,900 clothes dryer fires are reported in residences every year, resulting in about five deaths, 100 injuries and $35 million in property loss. The leading reason for the fires is failure to clean out the vents. Lingering dust, lint and fiber can ignite. Remove lint from the dryer’s trap after every load and keep the area behind the dryer clean. Also ensure that the vent is unobstructed and air flows freely to the outside.</p>
<h2>5. Kitchen</h2>
<p>Kitchen fires are the number one cause of home fires, the U.S. Fire Administration reports. In 2010, the National Fire Protection Association found that 156,400 homes were damaged as a result of a kitchen fire. The fires resulted in 420 deaths, 5,310 injuries and $993 million in damages. Never leave the kitchen when something is cooking on the stove, and ensure that your appliances and equipment are functioning properly.</p>
<h2>6. Fireplace</h2>
<p>Before you light a fire, ensure that your chimney’s flue works properly and that the interior of the chimney does not have a build-up of creosote, which is a brown or black substance that is highly flammable. Prevent problems by having the chimney swept yearly by a professional.</p>
<h2>7. Wiring</h2>
<p>Bad wiring can affect any area of the home. Wires can short out and start a fire. Signs that you may have trouble include flickering lights, frequent blown fuses and feeling a tingling or slight shock when you touch an appliance or wall switch. If you suspect a problem, call in a certified electrician as soon as possible.<br />
Now that you know how to protect your loved ones and your home from potential danger, rest assured in your safe haven.</p>

Whether the look is vintage, vamp or vixen, the trending word this fall is repurpose. </p>
<p>Once you’ve splurged on a costly item, create a multi-layered style story to give your purchase wings. Inspired by the signature hue of the season — green — here are tips on how to flip your newest stunner into three different outfits. </p>
<p>Fashionistas pledge allegiance to one rule: <strong>splurge responsibly</strong>. Select a classic piece that can be reused and even withstand multiple Facebook appearances without being bombed by the style police. Stellar forest green buys include: a motorcycle jacket, cable knit sweater, faux fur vest, an A-line skirt and leather booties. By boldly pairing your new James Dean moto jacket with low-key accessorizes and pre-existing closet staples, you can continuously rock out without maxing it out. </p>
<p>Celebrities such as <a href="http://www.jessicasimpson.com" target="_blank">Jessica Simpson</a> and <a href="http://khloekardashian.celebuzz.com" target="_blank">Khloe Kardashian</a> support the guilt-free faux fur trend. Kardashian even confessed to fans on her website, “This season, faux fur takes on new life in everything from collars, to vests, to ear muffs … and I’m loving all of it!” </p>
<h2>First look</h2>
<p>If you’re working your way up to Kardashian bracket ‘kash,’ Los Angeles stylist, <a href="http://rebeccabrie.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Rebecca Brie</a>, has three economical solutions. The wardrobe wiz, who recently styled a Cover Girl campaign featuring real women, favors clean silhouettes over ill-fitting layers. She suggests pairing an <a href="http://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2012/09/07/pologeorgis-green-raccoon-fur-vest-product-3-4669284-840251640_large_flex.jpeg" target="_blank">emerald faux fur vest</a> “with a fitted turtleneck or blouse. Add in leather leggings. They’re a must have item, especially for a more dressed up look.” Brie suggests checking out Zara or Top Shop for inexpensive leggings, or Rag and Bone or J-Brand for longer-lasting products. “Throw on some short leather ankle boots” and you’re golden. </p>
<p>To celebrate your second fur iteration, embrace your inner flirt. Brie pairs the vest with a “short skirt or dress, with high heel ankle boots.” Depending on the occasion, you can also jazz up the look by synching your waist with a thin animal print belt to accentuate your figure. “You can never have too much animal print in your closet. I’m always looking for cool pieces with leopard, zebra or cheetah prints. It makes a statement and provides a twist to any outfit. I like to say ‘animal print is the new black’ because it goes with everything.” Whip out the faux fur on a Sunday for your last look. “I like to wear mine on a casual day with flats, skinny jeans, and a T-shirt,” she says. </p>
<h2>Second look</h2>
<p>Versatile styling translates well in bold staples and classics. Couture designer, Christian Dior, initially revealed A-line skirts in 1955. Sewn to hug one’s hips with a sharp flare at the knee, they’ve remained in high rotation ever since. Jason Rembert, the stylist behind captivating looks seen on it-girls like Olivia Palermo and Selita Eubanks, favors the skirt. </p>
<p>To produce three looks, he suggests that women, “do an <a href="http://cdn.relaxpics.com/show/imgs/e0840af89652a074b5e734492b9859de.jpg" target="_blank">emerald A-line skirt</a> and wear it to work with a grey sweater or sweatshirt. Belt it and give it a waistline, with a button-up shirt underneath. Add a statement necklace.” To transition to cocktails at night, “take off the button-up and sweater and throw on a silk shirt, with a black fancier belt. That can be a dressier look. Leave the top button unbuttoned and add a simple, personal necklace, perhaps something gifted by a boyfriend or your mother.” Add a “hand full of rings,” to cap it off. You can also channel your inner vixen by toting the A-line along for a weekend getaway. “Pair it with a crop top and sneakers in Miami. Add in some busy earrings,” a la J-Lo, he says. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_193" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywyse-HouseofHaunts.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Le living and co" width="600" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-193" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lelivingandco/8131556408/" target="_blank">Photo courtesy of Le living and co</a></p></div><br />
If you’re planning a spine-tingling Halloween affair or hosting a group of eager trick-o-treaters, there’s no reason to put a dent in your budget. Turn your abode into a house of haunts by making it a family affair. Gather your spouse and/or kids to transform average household items into festive decor. </p>
<p>First, prepare a craft area. Cover your dining room table with fabric or butcher paper. Secure the table’s edges with tape or safety pins. Lay an equally impenetrable layer on the floor. Whip out the paint and allow your kids to get splatter paint crazy. Encourage them to create their most ghoulish designs by using white sheets and towels as a canvas. Drape their dried work over furniture or use as decorative pillow covers. You can also create the effect of bloody walls by dipping your hands in red paint and stamping them on white butcher paper. Affix the ghastly designs to the walls of your hallway and line them with colorful, electric candles, varying in height. </p>
<p>Once crafting time has finished, convert the table (splatter paint and all) into a festive art space in preparation of guests. During the soiree, provide your guests with an activity. Provide cheap plastic masks found at any arts store and room to adorn the masks with decorations. Whether it be glitter, buttons from your sewing kit, feathers from a shedding boa or costume jewelry, rummage through your closet to make an offering for the sake of the spook.</p>
<p>No Halloween party would be complete without pumpkins. Put a twist on tradition by using metallic spray paint to spruce up the fruit for its big day. Lay down newspaper in a well-ventilated space. Hold your pumpkin by the stem and spray paint it silver, yellow or rose gold. String name cards from the stems of mini metallic pumpkins to act as placeholders at the dinner table. They also make dynamic party favors. </p>
<p>Harvest a few branches from a tree on your lawn. Leaves can also be spray painted and hung from black gauze curtains to enhance your house of haunts. Don’t be afraid to pluck the feathers from that trusty black boa to create a front door wreath. Boas can also double as staircase wraps. </p>
<p>Entice your visitors with all things creepy crawly by strategically hanging homemade spiders and bats throughout the space. The bodies of the warm-blooded animals can be crafted by stuffing newspaper into black hosiery. Bat ears can be made out of construction paper. Wings and spider legs can be fashioned out of old umbrellas. Your handcrafted, eight-legged wonder can rest comfortably in a web made by strumming yarn from the corners of vacant picture frames. Place them in corners to ante up the fear factor.</p>
<p>Once you and your family are fully costumed, nothing says supernatural-like ‘shrunken heads.’ Apples and pears can be peeled and carved to resemble human faces. Dunk them in a bath of lemon juice and salt for 30 minutes. After drying the fruit overnight, pump up the terror by strategically placing the ‘shrunken heads’ on mantles or even in the bathroom. Placement should depend on how creepy you want the vibe to be.</p>
<p>With screams expected, wet the partygoer’s palettes with ‘witches brew.’ Served from a black cauldron, aka the largest pot in your kitchen, mix a concoction of berries, ginger ale, gelatin and cider with a block of dry ice, which will emit a smoky fog. </p>
<p>To ensure that all are properly spooked, play scary music and horror films in the background. Dust off your Polaroid camera. Email a collage of the snapshots to guests the next day in remembrance of the moment. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187" alt="102113-Pennywyse-COCONUTOIL" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/102113-Pennywyse-COCONUTOIL1.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br />
Would you pay $9 for a product that is as beneficial for the outside of your body as it is for the inside of your body? One item can be used as a body moisturizer, lip balm, hair mask and cuticle conditioner. This same product is also a food and is consumed raw, cooked and baked.</p>
<p>Have you heard of virgin coconut oil or VCO? It is natural, versatile, affordable and readily available. (Warning: Do not want to use coconut oil if you are allergic to nuts or coconuts.)</p>
<h2>Use in your food</h2>
<p>VCO has been used for generations in the Philippines. A 2011 study conducted by The University of San Carlos Office of Population Studies Foundation in Cebu City, Philippines, tested coconut oil&#8217;s affect on cholesterol levels and the risk for cardiac disease. Nearly 2,000 pre-menopausal women were part of the study.</p>
<p>Coconut oil intake was measured by asking the women to recall their coconut oil use over two 24-hour periods and, on average, women reported use of just a little more than 2 teaspoons of coconut oil each day. Coconut oil intake was found to be higher in younger women living in wealthier households in more urban areas with more education.</p>
<p>The study, which was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and published in a 2011 issue of the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that ingesting coconut oil resulted in a positive blood lipid profile especially the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels (HDL, the &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol).</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite its classification as a saturated fat, its biochemical makeup and smaller molecular size is such that the body metabolizes VCO in a healthier way than other saturated fats,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.juiceladycherie.com/Juice/" target="_blank">Cherie Calbom</a>, nutritionist and author of <a href="http://www.juiceladycherie.com/Juice/coconut-weight-loss/" target="_blank">&#8220;The Coconut Diet.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Use coconut oil to add more of the healthy fat and decrease the unhealthy saturated fats in your diet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a couple of tablespoons to any smoothie.</li>
<li>Substitute VCO for half the amount of butter called for in any baked goods recipe for muffins, fruit breads or cookies.</li>
<li>Sauté vegetables or even cook pancakes in VCO instead of butter or vegetable or corn oil.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use on your body</h2>
<p>&#8220;Because VCO is highly absorbed by the skin it&#8217;s an effective moisturizer and softener, says dermatological nurse-practitioner Jodi LoGerfo of the Orentreich Medical Group in New York City. &#8220;Used at room temperature (in its solid state) it makes an ideal ointment to relieve dehydrated, chapped, rough, scaly and itchy skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>LoGerfo also says VCO may improve skin barrier function to protect skin from fungus and bacteria intrusion and improve skin&#8217;s ability to retain moisture. In animal studies, coconut oil has even been shown to improve the time it takes for wounds to heal and increase collagen production.</p>
<p>Use VCO as liquid oil or a solid moisturizer, on wet or dry skin in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>An all-over body moisturizer</li>
<li>Bath oil</li>
<li>Lip balm</li>
<li>Cuticle conditioner</li>
<li>Massage oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply sparingly as a little goes a long way. Because coconut oil can be greasy, wait a few minutes before getting dressed.</p>
<h2>Use for your hair</h2>
<p>LoGerfo explains that in addition to its high absorbability, VCO contains lauric acid, which has a high attraction for hair protein. &#8220;Any way you use it on hair, VCO has been recognized for having a positive benefit on the tensile strength and properties of hair as it also moisturizes hair and coats hair’s outer cuticle, preventing hair damage and protein loss from combing, brushing and chemical treatments,&#8221; she says. Try:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scalp massage</li>
<li>A pre-wash scalp treatment, to help or eliminate dandruff</li>
<li>A deep conditioning treatment from the roots to tips</li>
</ul>
<p>Always use VCO on your hair and scalp are dry; otherwise water stops the oil from penetrating the hair effectively. To remove VCO from your hair, do not wash it out the usual way. Instead, lather shampoo in your hands first, apply directly to your hair and scalp, then rinse thoroughly.</p>
<h2>Where can you find it?</h2>
<p>&#8220;Always buy virgin coconut oil because it is minimally processed. It retains the active ingredients and has no preservatives, additives or color. It&#8217;s available at any local health food store or online. Plus, only VCO has that tropical, coconut smell,&#8221; LoGerfo says.</p>
<p>A 14 oz. jar of organic unrefined expeller-pressed VCO typically costs about $9. You&#8217;ll probably need one jar for the kitchen and another for the bathroom.</p>
<p>At room temperature or cooler, coconut oil has a butter-like consistency. But if you place the jar in a warm-water bath, it melts and can be used as massage oil, moisturizer or as a hair mask. You could also pour the warmed oil into a travel-sized container and, when cooled, could be used as a lip balm or a cuticle conditioner.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to cut your beauty costs dramatically or you&#8217;re more of a naturalist and don&#8217;t want to put anything on your body that you wouldn&#8217;t put in it, VCO is the product for you.</p>

Trumping men’s buying habits, a study conducted by Parks Associates and unveiled at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, says that women are more likely to purchase consumer electronic products. They are also more susceptible to breast cancer.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a>, 1 in 8 American women will battle the disease over their lifetime. Since 1985, the American Cancer Society has partnered with other charities to champion <a href="http://www.nbcam.org/" target="_blank">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>. Their goal remains to raise funds for research, education, prevention and treatment in the ongoing race for a cure.</p>
<p>Backed by corporate campaigns, the “Think Pink” ribbon logo is stamped on everything from sneakers to bath products. This year you might notice more electronics donning a pink suit. We’ve compiled a list of the hottest and most economical consumer technology buys that support the cause.</p>
<p><a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=318-1626" target="_blank"><br />

<p>Last year alone, Komen’s audited financial records show that they invested $69 million dollars into research and more than $249 million to screening, education and treatment programs for women.

<h2>Before buying, read the fine print</h2>
<p>Any company can stamp a pink logo on its products. To ensure that they’re truly giving back, make sure its website or packaging details the amount of donations made through sales. </p>
<p>You can also see how your charity of choice stacks up by logging onto <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/" target="_blank">Charity Navigator</a>. It offers a snapshot of how funding is allocated, from research to programming. When purchasing products, you can now both “Think Pink” and “Think Smart.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-155" alt="101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap.jpg" width="600" height="400" />While we all aspire to be DIY mavens, when juggling families and careers oftentimes convenience wins out. Although you may not have time to bake bread from scratch, when planning this year’s fall soiree, don’t underestimate the power of doing it yourself. Whether you’re planning a swanky Halloween bash or autumn dinner party, here are tips on hosting a simple, cheap and chic affair.</p>
<p>Just because your wallet is thin, doesn’t mean you can’t throw a fabulous event. Party planning extraordinaire, <a href="http://eventsbyandrewells.com" target="_blank">Andre Wells</a> has designed corporate events for Disney, NBC and the White House, yet he admits that the best parties happen at home.</p>
<p>“Whether you are entertaining four guests or 40, preparation is the key to success,” he says. “Keep a good ‘decordrobe’ for your dining room table.”</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-157" alt="101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap1" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap1.jpg" width="300" height="101" />By investing in seasonal table décor — dinnerware, napkins and tablecloths — you’ll always feel prepared. Buying one setting per season will equal less money and less stress. You’ll avoid having to re-conceptualize your theme each time you plan an event.</p>
<p>When on a budget, hosts should maintain a focal point. Transform your dining room into an eye-catching space by adorning it with all things festive. Fall offers an array of options for dynamic centerpieces.</p>
<p>“Squash, corn, pumpkin, acorns, they make for a really beautiful display,” Wells says. Gorgeous woven baskets of various shapes and sizes can be found at dollar stores. Fill them with hay and stack them with lush vegetables. Spice it up by adding bedazzled fruit. Anchor the basket with a DIY table runner. Sew yarn into a rustic piece of burlap to add simplistic flair.</p>
<p>Fruit, veggies and inexpensive florals are all available at your local farmer’s market. Wells, who has planned more than 4,000 events for celebrities and politicians, has also worked with limited budgets.</p>
<p>“I like magnolia branches and leaves. They take you right through fall — from Halloween to Thanksgiving, Chanukah and Christmas. We gather fall leaves. Throw them on the floor of the party and onto the tables.” In smaller vessels, “add fall colored roses that come in orange, taupe and creams. You can break them at their heads and place them on the table.”</p>
<p>Floral arrangements are paramount to fall dinner parties. The event planner stresses, “Scent is one of the most important yet forgotten senses. It plays a much larger role in entertaining at home than it does at large functions. Be sure that the first breath guests take when they enter is a pleasant one.”</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-159" alt="101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap2" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-ChicnCheap2.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Other natural scents include cranking up your fireplace. Invite guests to cozy up near the burning wood. “It always gives that whole feeling of Halloween and fall. … And I love the smell of warm cider. You can boil it and your home will be filled with all of the scents in the pot. You can also mull red wine and cider” for an enticing medley of scents.</p>
<p>Don’t fret if you have no time to prepare the cider. Take a hint from the Egyptians and pick up incense for less than $5.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to splurge, do so on a timeless incense holder that doubles as a sculpture. Los Angeles artist Suzanne Wright creates hand-cast holders out of whalebone, carried exclusively at <a href="http://otherwild.com/products/suzanne-wright-incense-holder" target="_blank">Otherwild</a>.</p>
<p>Wells says once the ambience is set turn down the lights.</p>
<p>“Go to a place like Target and get different sized vases. Fill them with water and buy floating candles. Add dye, orange colored food coloring, or even blue, which comes across as black. It will give the water a pool glow. Cut the lights off. Tell all of your guests to put on their masks.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_112" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-112" alt="Technology can help shoppers save money at home and at the store. " src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-Smartphone.jpg" width="600" height="487" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Technology can help shoppers save money at home and at the store.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that retailers are aggressively vying for our dollars. But did you realize they are constantly adding to their bag of tricks to entice us to buy because we now love shopping on smartphones and tablets? You can beat retailers at their own game, says Niraj Shah, chief executive officer of the e-commerce site Wayfair.com.</p>
<p>He says that using your tablet and/or smartphone while shopping, whether in-store or online, can provide some surprising new ways to find and use discounts you might not get otherwise. Check out these sneaky smartphone tips and tricks:</p>
<h2>Find different prices, discounts with different devices</h2>
<p>Remember hearing a story last year about Orbitz showing different prices to Apple product users? Shah says retailers are also offering special deals for people shopping from smartphones and tablets and that retailers might show different products, discounts and prices depending on the user, the device and even the location.</p>
<p><strong>Sneaky smartphone solution:</strong> Shah advises price-checking and searching for deals and discounts on your mobile devices even if you&#8217;re standing in a store or planning to order from your personal computer.</p>
<h2>Search smarter</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a specific product by using a search engine, such as Google or Yahoo, you’ll get the best online search results by being as specific as possible when typing in the search box, Shah says. Take the time to focus your search to ferret out hidden sales and discount information.</p>
<p><strong>Sneaky smartphone solution:</strong> To find additional discounts, log on to a retailer’s website. Search for the product name you would like to purchase followed by the words gift with purchase. Try swapping out these keywords as well: rebate, bundle, daily deal and coupon code. You can also try this exercise on any search engine. It might take awhile, but the savings could pile up.</p>
<h2>Track prices</h2>
<p>Be aware that many brands set a Minimum Advertised Price, called MAP, that retailers cannot go below. You can learn that price by tracking a product&#8217;s price as well as other similar products over a few weeks. Shah says, this way, you will be able to recognize the lowest possible price when you see it.</p>
<p><strong>Sneaky smartphone solution:</strong> If you are planning a medium- to big-ticket item or electronics purchase, set up email or text alerts on Decide.com or Dealnews.com to know when to strike.</p>
<h2>Other sneaky savings solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check-in with social media:</strong> Always check a retailer’s or brand&#8217;s Facebook and Twitter accounts for special social media-only flash-deals and daily deals and discounts. Never checkout, online or in-store, before checking in.</li>
<li><strong>• Abandon your cart for enticing savings:</strong> Online retailers will continue to convince shoppers to buy, especially if you&#8217;ve abandoned your online cart or if you&#8217;ve set up an account for the first time. A few days before making a large purchase, set up an account on a retailer’s website and you will probably get an introductory savings discount via email. Even better, fill up an online cart and abandon it; retailers hate that. Even Kate Spade will send you a reminder email along with a sweet discount on a hot handbag.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sneaky savings solutions definitely add a few minutes to your shopping time but so what? Why pay more if you don&#8217;t have to?</p>
<p>What sneaky savings solutions could you add to the list? Try these and let us know what discounts you got or how much you saved!</p>

How come the UGGs I want are [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96" alt="101413-Pennywyse-UGG3" src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-UGG3.jpg" width="600" height="400" />Footwear buyers across the retail spectrum have said they have ordered fewer women&#8217;s UGG boots for their stores this year. That leaves UGG with plenty of leftovers to go around, which is good news if you&#8217;ve always wanted a pair but didn&#8217;t want to pay the high price.</p>
<h2>How come the UGGs I want are never on sale?</h2>
<p>When UGGs first appeared on Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things List in 2003, the now-iconic boots were in high demand and in low supply at very few stores, which drove up the price.</p>
<p>Aside from creating a high-quality product made of real leather with sheepskin lining that is truly warm and useful, UGG has been very strict about its pricing and distribution policies. All retailers are supposed to abide by the Minimum Advertised Price, also known as MAP, which stops retailers from advertising UGGs below a set price.</p>
<h2>Why UGGs are popping up on sale now</h2>
<p>With two warm winters in a row and the fuzzy footwear available just about everywhere, online and in many department stores, there was finally consumer pushback. UGG rolled back its prices last fall instead of traditionally increasing the price of its most-favored &#8220;Classic&#8221; boot line. If the price had gone up, the &#8220;Classic Tall&#8221; style would have crossed the $200 threshold.</p>
<div id="attachment_99" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-full wp-image-99" alt="UGG &quot;Lo-Pro&quot; denim boots, originally $160, now $79.99, at T.J. Maxx in New York." src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-Ugg2.jpeg" width="300" height="250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">UGG &#8220;Lo-Pro&#8221; denim boots, originally $160, now $79.99, at T.J. Maxx in New York.</p></div>
<p>In an effort to reignite demand for the brand, UGG Australia also created a wide assortment of new styles. Some of the new styles build on the classic UGG look, but now have sparkles, tassels and more colors to choose from.</p>
<p>Other new styles are high-priced, healed fashion boots and clogs in leather and suede. Even though they have the UGG sheepskin lining, they do not have that quintessential UGG look or shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how beautiful those fashion boots are, nobody&#8217;s paying $300 for them when you can&#8217;t tell they are UGGs,&#8221; one buyer said recently.</p>
<p>In January, UGG allowed its retailers to mark down 35 discontinued styles up to 33 percent off the retail price to move the products off the racks. Some of those shoes look exactly like classic UGGs but with little embellishments such as studs or a strap. Now you can find those and more recent styles at up to 60 percent off, if you know where to look.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s the insider scoop</h2>
<div id="attachment_101" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 260px"><img class="size-full wp-image-101" alt="At left, the UGG &quot;Evera Canvas&quot; sneaker, originally 109.95, now $39.99, at Marshalls in Florida.

At right, the UGG &#8220;Laela Heirloom&#8221; sneaker, originally $119.95, is $39.99 at Marshalls in Florida.</p></div>
<p>Off-price stores such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are currently selling some styles for a fraction of the original price. There are also rumors of palettes of men&#8217;s slippers being delivered to Costco and some fashion boots on sale at Saks Off 5th.</p>
<p>Another off-price online retailer, 6pm.com, has approximately (at last count, which can change daily) 64 UGG summer wedges and sandals and 32 fashion and snow boots for more than 50 percent off the regular price.</p>
<p>There are several UGG snow boots priced in the $70 range, which is about at 45 percent off the normal retail price.</p>
<p>Managers at Marshalls and T.J. Maxx say they receive shipments of shoes usually about four times a week, but they never know which shoes are being delivered or when. So if you want UGGs, check in often and you just might snag a pair of real UGGs for real cheap.</p>
<p>Are you feeling all warm and fuzzy about a pair of UGGs you found for cheap? Tell us where you snagged them and post a picture in the comments.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how important it is to stay on budget than restaurant chefs. Whether it’s a local Applebee’s or that chic little French bistro down the street, “a budget is key to every restaurant’s survival,” says Jill Davie, co-host of Shopping with Chefs on the Fine Living Channel. “If we don’t stick to our budget, we can have a great month in terms of customers but not make any money,” she says. “Keep that up and we’re out of business.”</p>
<p>The sentiment translates to you, the home cook. You won’t necessarily go under if you blow your food budget, but the money you have to save or spend on fixed costs like car payments, the mortgage or monthly rent, can certainly take a hit.</p>
<p>Whether you’re entertaining this holiday season or just trying to feed your family for less, take some tips from the pros. Here are money-saving secrets from Davie, who has real-world experience as the former Chef de Cuisine at Josie Restaurant in Santa Monica, California.</p>
<h2>Use less expensive, quality ingredients</h2>
<div id="attachment_78" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><img class="size-full wp-image-78" alt="Buying a whole chicken and roasting it is cheaper than buying boneless, skinless chicken breasts." src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-HomeRestaurant3.jpg" width="200" height="144" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Buying a whole chicken and roasting it is cheaper than buying chicken breasts.</p></div>
<p>Instead of buying boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which can be very expensive, buy a whole chicken and teach yourself how to break it down. “You’ll pay as much for boneless, skinless chicken breasts as you will for the whole bird,” Chef Davie says.</p>
<p>You can use the core of the carcass for making stock, thighs for chicken salad and the two chicken breasts for a third dish. Your other option is to buy packaged chicken thighs. They’re an inexpensive cut of chicken and full of flavor. Some of Davie’s other favorite inexpensive cuts of meat include flank, skirt, or flat iron steak and pork shoulder.</p>
<p>Stumped about how to break down a chicken or how to prepare these particular cuts of meat? Do a web search on Epicurious.com or even YouTube.com. “There are so many great recipes online,” Davie says. <b></b></p>
<h2>Waste not</h2>
<p>Chef Davie has a passion for fine food and wine, but she’s also mindful of how much she spends on food and how much she throws away, whether she’s at work or cooking at home. “I try to use everything. The sign of a good chef is an empty trash can,” Davie says.</p>
<p>In fact, one of her latest home creations was using leftover hotdog buns from a football party to create orange cream cheese French toast. She’s also been known to use beet greens. “You can cook the tops of the beets and use them just like spinach or broccoli,” she says.</p>
<h2>Don’t lose it — use it</h2>
<div id="attachment_77" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><img class="size-full wp-image-77" alt="Roast vegetables for about 20 minutes for a delicious side dish for tonight's dinner." src="http://pushpenny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413-Pennywyse-HomeRestaurant2.jpg" width="200" height="132" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Roast vegetables for about 20 minutes for a delicious side dish for tonight&#8217;s dinner.</p></div>
<p>“In the restaurant business, we buy in such bulk that things often start going bad before we can use them,” Davie says. Before that happens at home, take action. “If it’s produce, cook it,” Davie says.</p>
<p>If your tomatoes are on their last legs, for example, make tomato sauce and freeze it for use later. Whatever veggies are going bad, roast them for tonight’s dinner. Toss them in a little olive oil, salt and pepper and pop them in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. “Pretty much any vegetable can be done that way,” Davie says. If it’s meat or fish, freeze it. “I won’t use frozen fish in the restaurant, but I will make a stock out of it,” Davie says. One idea is to use frozen fish as a base for Asian soups such as pho. Meat and fish will keep in the freezer for 4 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Shop with cash</h2>
<p>When it’s slow in the restaurant business, the food budget gets especially tight. “There have been months when I had to be very mindful of everything I spent because I wasn’t sure if I’d have the revenue to pay off a large food bill,” Davie says. That’s when she learned not to use credit. “Using cash forces you to stick to your food budget and not buy a bunch of random stuff,” Davie says.</p>
<p>All you home chefs out there, do you have any secrets for staying within your food budget? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
